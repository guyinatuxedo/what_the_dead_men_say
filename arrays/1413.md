## Description

Given an array of integers nums, you start with an initial positive value startValue.

In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of startValue plus elements in nums (from left to right).

Return the minimum positive value of startValue such that the step by step sum is never less than 1.

## Java Iterative Find Min

So we need to ensure the current value is greater than 1. For this we can find the min value. If the min value is greater than or equal to 0, then the starting value needs to be 1. If it is negative, than the starting value needs to be equal to `(min * -1) + 1`. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int minStartValue(int[] nums) {
        int i, n, x, min;
        
        n = nums.length;
        x = 0;
        min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            x += nums[i];
            min = Math.min(min, x);
        }
        
        if (min >= 0) return 1;
        
        return (min * -1) + 1;
    }
}
```
