## Description

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

## Java Dynamic Programming

The idea hebind this solution is for each spot, is to an iterate through each price in the input. For each input, we will calculate the maximum profit gained from a transaction up to the price, and to the right of the price. We calculate it by subtracting the minimum prices to the current one, or this price from the maximum. We compare these two to the maximum profit with the original one, and set the profits equal to the max one between the two. We also update the min value to the left / max value to the right if need be. Then after we've calculated the values for all of the profits, we will get the maximum profit possible by iterating through each of the calulated profits and adding them together, then comparing them to the max profit we've seen so far.

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        if (n <= 0) return 0;
        
        int[] leftProfits = new int[n];
        int[] rightProfits = new int[n + 1];
        
        int leftMin = prices[0];
        int rightMax = prices[n - 1];
        int i, j;
        for (i = 1; i < prices.length; ++i) {
            leftProfits[i] = Math.max(leftProfits[i - 1], prices[i] - leftMin);
            leftMin = Math.min(leftMin, prices[i]);
            
            j = n - i - 1;
            rightProfits[j] = Math.max(rightProfits[j + 1], rightMax - prices[j]);
            rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, prices[j]);
        }
        
        int maxRoi = 0;
        
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            maxRoi = Math.max(maxRoi, rightProfits[i + 1] + leftProfits[i]);
        }
        
        return maxRoi;
    }
}
```

## Java One Pass

This is an optimized solution from leetcode. This solves the problem with `O(1)` space in a single pass. It works via calulating the max profit from the first transaction, then calculating the maximum profit from the second transition. We iterate through each of the prices, calculating the maximum transaction via subtracting the lowest price from the highest price we've seen. We factor in the second transaction via subtracting the profit from the first transaction from the cost of the second.

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int t0Cost, t1Cost;
        int t0Profit, t1Profit;
        
        t0Cost = t1Cost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        t0Profit = t1Profit = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            t0Cost = Math.min(t0Cost, price);
            t0Profit = Math.max(t0Profit, price - t0Cost);
            
            t1Cost = Math.min(t1Cost, price - t0Profit);
            t1Profit = Math.max(t1Profit, price - t1Cost);
        }
        
        return t1Profit;
    }
}
```
