## Description

Given a string s, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return the power of the string.

## Java Iteration

This was my first solution for this problem. The idea behind it is we just iterate through the array, counting the length of substrings with the same character, and then checking to see if that is the max substring. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int maxPower(String s) {
        int i, n, max, substring;
        
        substring = max = 1;
        n = s.length();
        
        for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                substring += 1;
                max = Math.max(substring, max);
            }
            
            else substring = 1;
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```
