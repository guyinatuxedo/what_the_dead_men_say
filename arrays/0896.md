## Description

An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

An array A is monotone increasing if for all i <= j, A[i] <= A[j].  An array A is monotone decreasing if for all i <= j, A[i] >= A[j].

Return true if and only if the given array A is monotonic.

## Java Iteration

So for this solution, we iterate through the array. As soon as we see either an increase or decrease, we set the direction to be that way. Whenever there is a subsequent increase/decrease, we check ot see if it matches the direction. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isMonotonic(int[] A) {
        int n, direction;
        n = A.length;
        
        direction = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (A[i] == A[i + 1]) continue;
            
            else if (A[i] < A[i + 1]) {
                if (direction == 0) direction = 1;
                
                else if (direction == 2) return false;
            }
            
            else {
                if (direction == 0) direction = 2;
                
                else if (direction == 1) return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
