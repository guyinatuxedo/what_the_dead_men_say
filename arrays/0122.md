## Description

Say you have an array price for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

## Java Single Pass Profitable Ranges

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. Anytime the stock price drops, if there is a lesser price before it that wasn't used in another trade, that is a range of stock prices we can profit from. So we iterate through the array, keeping track of the min price of the stock that wasn't used in another trade. If we see the stock price dip, and that the current min is less than the current price, we know that is a range we can profit from and we add it to the profit. We also do a check at the end, incase the array ends with a profitable stock sale.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` due to the linear pass, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max_profit, i, n, current_min;
        
        n = prices.length;
        
        max_profit = 0;
        
        current_min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Check for a drop in the stock price
            if ((i < n - 1) && (prices[i + 1] < prices[i])) {
                // Check if this is another range we can profit from
                if (current_min < prices[i]) {
                    max_profit += prices[i] - current_min;
                    current_min = prices[i];
                }
            }

            // Check if the local min needs to be updated
            if ((prices[i] < current_min)) {
                current_min = prices[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Check if the array ends with a profitable sell
        if (current_min != prices[i - 1]) {
            max_profit += prices[i - 1] - current_min;
        }
        
        return max_profit;
    }
}
```

## Java Single Pass Increase Sumnation

So this is a much simpler solution to this problem I saw on leetcode. The idea behind it is this. We can buy and sell this stock at anytime (although it can only be one transaction at a time). As such, anytime the stock increases in value, we can buy and sell the stock to take the full value of that increase, while avoiding any losses. This means the only thing we need to keep track of is increases in the stock prices.

So we just iterate through the array, looking for any increases in the stock price, and adding them to the profit. The runtime cost for this algorithm is again `O(n)` and the memory cost of this algorithm is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max_profit, i, n;
        
        n = prices.length;
        max_profit = 0;
        
        // Iterate through stock prices
        for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            // Check for increase in stock price
            if (prices[i + 1] > prices[i]) {
                max_profit += (prices[i + 1] - prices[i]);
            }
        }
               
        return max_profit;
    }
}
```
