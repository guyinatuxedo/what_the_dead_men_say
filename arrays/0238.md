## Description

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

```
Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

## Solution Java Multi-Array

So this solution took me a bit to come up with. After staring at this problem a while, I realized something. The value of each item in the array, is equal to the product of all of the values on the left side, with the product of all of the values on the right side. For the edges where there isn't a left or a right side, we can just substitute in a `1` for the side that doesn't exist (when is the same as just setting it equal to the product of the side that does exist).

So what we will do here, is make three different passes through the input array. The first time, we will iterate from right to left, starting from the second element. The purpose of this is to calculate the product of all of the values including it, and the elements to the left. Then we will do the same thing, but from the perspective of the right. Then lastly, we will calculate the return values by iterating through, and setting the return values equal to the left, and right products.

This algorithm will need three seperate arrays. One For the products from the left, one for the products from the right, and one for the return values. So the memory cost will be `O(n)`. In terms of the runtime cost for this algorithm we will make three passes through the input array, so the runtime cost is `O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        // Grab the length of the input array
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Create our three arrays        
        int[] leftProducts = new int[n];
        int[] rightProducts = new int[n];
        int[] results = new int[n];
        
        // Populate the products from the left perspective
        leftProducts[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            leftProducts[i] = leftProducts[i - 1] * nums[i];
        }

        // Populate the products from the left perspective
        rightProducts[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            rightProducts[i] = rightProducts[i + 1] * nums[i];
        }
        
        // Calculate the results
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++)
        {
            results[i] = leftProducts[i - 1] * rightProducts[i + 1];
        }
        
        // Set the results for the ends
        results[0] = rightProducts[1];
        results[n - 1] = leftProducts[n - 2];
        
        return results;
    }
}
```

## Solution Java Array Optimized

So this is pretty similar to the above solution. The main difference between this and the above one, is we don't use arrays to store the products from the left/right perspectives. We first iterate through, and store the products from the left in the output array. Then as we're iterating through the right, we keep the product stored in a single variable. That way the only dynamic memory cost with this, is the output array. Thus it brings down the memory cost to `O(n)` (per the problem statement, output memory doesn't count for this). The runtime cost is still the same at `O(n)`, however this time we only make 2 passes down the input array instead of 3.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        // Grab the length of the input array
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Create our results array
        int[] results = new int[n];
        
        // Populate the array from the left perspective
        results[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            results[i] = results[i - 1] * nums[i];
        }

        // Save the value, which will be the final output result
        int tmp = results[n - 2];
        
        // Calculate the output values, factoring in the right side
        int rightProduct = 1;
        for (int i = n - 2; i > 0; i--)
        {
            rightProduct *= nums[i + 1];
            results[i] = results[i - 1] * rightProduct;
        }
        
        // Set the edge values
        results[0] = rightProduct * nums[1];
        results[n - 1] = tmp;
        
        return results;
    }
}

```
