## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

## Java Recursion

So the idea behind this solution, is we recurse through the input array. As we go through, we check if the next element is bigger than the current element, and if so we make a recursive call checking the next element. Regardless of that, we will make another recursive call which compares the current element to the one past the next. That way we can find sequences both where the numbers are together, and spread apart. Also we start checking with an index before the start of the array, that way we won't get stuck comparing everything against the first element of the array. Lastly as a performance boost (so we don't exceed the time limit) I have a 2D array which I store all of my results. That way I won't need to redo calculations.

```
class Solution {
    private final int START_INDEX = -1;
    private final int NOT_VISITED = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < 1) return 0;
        int[][] solved = new int[n + 1][n];
        for (int [] array : solved) {
            Arrays.fill(array, NOT_VISITED);
        }
        return hope(nums, START_INDEX, 0, solved);
    }
    
    public int hope(int[] nums, int start, int next, int[][] solved) {
        if (next >= nums.length) return 0;
        
        int x, y, z;
        
        x = y = z = 0;
        
        if (solved[start + 1][next] != NOT_VISITED) {
            return solved[start + 1][next];
        }
        if (start == START_INDEX || nums[next] > nums[start]) {
            x = 1 + hope(nums, next, next+1, solved);
        }
        
        y = hope(nums, start, next+1, solved);
        
        z = Math.max(x, y);
        
        solved[start+1][next] = z;
        return z;
    }
}
