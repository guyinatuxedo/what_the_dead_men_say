## Description

Let's call any (contiguous) subarray B (of A) a mountain if the following properties hold:

    B.length >= 3
    There exists some 0 < i < B.length - 1 such that B[0] < B[1] < ... B[i-1] < B[i] > B[i+1] > ... > B[B.length - 1]

(Note that B could be any subarray of A, including the entire array A.)

Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest mountain. 

Return 0 if there is no mountain.

## Java Two Pointers

This solution was from leetcode

So a mountain is defined as a series of numbers that increment, then after reaching a peak start decrementing. This is a perfect problem for a two pointers approach.

So we iterate through the input array. We can check for a potential start of a mountain via checking if the next number is greater than the current number. If it is, we can check if it is a mountain. We set the left base equal to the first number, and then iterate the right base up to the peak. We do this via moving the right base up until the numbers stop ascending. We do a check to make sure the next number after the peak is lesser, to verify it isn't just the end of the array. Then we move the right base forward until the numbers stop descending. Then the two pointers will be at the two ends of the mountain. Then we can see how long the mountain is, and if it is the longest we've seen so far, we update our longest mountain length.

```
class Solution {
    public int longestMountain(int[] A) {
        int n = A.length;
        
        int ans = 0;
        int leftBase, rightBase;
        leftBase = rightBase = 0;
        
        while (leftBase < n) {
            rightBase = leftBase;
            
            // Check if start of mountain
            if (leftBase + 1 < n && A[leftBase] < A[leftBase + 1]) {
                
                // Move rightBase towards the peak
                while (rightBase + 1 < n && A[rightBase] < A[rightBase + 1]) rightBase++;
                
                // Ensure this is a peak
                if (rightBase + 1 < n && A[rightBase] > A[rightBase + 1]) {
                    // Move rightBase towards the righ base
                    while (rightBase + 1 < n && A[rightBase] > A[rightBase + 1]) rightBase++;
                    ans = Math.max(ans, rightBase - leftBase + 1);
                }
            }
            
           leftBase = Math.max(rightBase, leftBase + 1);
            
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
