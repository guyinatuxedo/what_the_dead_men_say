## Description

Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to return true if s2 contains the permutation of s1. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the substring of the second string.

## Java Array

This solution was off of leetcode. The idea behind this solution is this. We count the number of characters in the string `s1`. Then we slide through the string s2, checking if there is any sequence of characters the length of `s1` that has the same character counts. If there are, than we have a permutation.

We keep the count via an int array. This array holds 26 ints, which each int representing the number of times we see a character (characters between a-z).

```
class Solution {
    public boolean checkInclusion(String s1, String s2) {
        Boolean equal = true;
        if (s1.length() > s2.length())
        {
            return false;
        }

        int[] s1count = new int[26];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++)
        {
            s1count[s1.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= s2.length() - s1.length(); i++)
        {
            int[] tmpCount = new int[26];
                
            for (int j = 0; j < s1.length(); j++)
            {
                tmpCount[s2.charAt(i + j) - 'a']++;
            }
            
            equal = true;
            for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++)
            {
                if (s1count[k] != tmpCount[k])
                {
                    equal = false;
                }
            }
            if (equal) return true;
         }
        
        return false;        
    }
}
