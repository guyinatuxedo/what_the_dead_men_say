## Java Dynamic Programming

So this is a problem that can be broken down into smaller problems. The total water stored across the board is equal to the summation of all of the water storage capacity for each individual spot. Luckily there is a nice simple formula which we can use to determine how much water one particular spot has. That is `x - height`. The variable `x` is equal to either the highest block on the left, or the heights block on the right, whichever is shorter. The reason for that is the shorter height of these two things, will be the highest the water can possibly go (since if you go higher, the water will spill over). Then the reason for the `- height` is since the higher the block is, the less space there is for water.

For the algorithm, we will make two passes through the input array. The first one, is to populate a new array with values, that are equal to the highest block on the left. Then we will make another pass, from right to left. We will keep the height highest block on the right stored in a variable. Then for each block as we iterate, we calculate the amount of water that block can hold, and add it.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we make two passes through the input array. The memory cost associated with this algorithm is also `O(n)`, since we make a new array that is as large as the input.

```
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        
        int maxHeight, ans, tmp;
        
        // Check for an null input
        if (height == null) return 0;
        
        
        // Make the array to store the max heights from the left
        int[] leftHeights = new int[height.length];
        
        // Find the max heights from the left
        maxHeight  = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < (height.length - 1); i++)
        {
            if (height[i] > maxHeight) maxHeight = height[i];  
            leftHeights[i] = maxHeight;
        }
        
        // Find hte max heights from the right
        // and calculate the amount of water each spot can hold
        ans = maxHeight = 0;
        for (int i = height.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            tmp = Math.min(leftHeights[i], maxHeight) - height[i];
            if (tmp > 0) ans += tmp;
            if (height[i] > maxHeight) maxHeight = height[i];
            
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
