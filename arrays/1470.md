## Problem

Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

## Java Iterative Two Pointers

So the idea behind this solution is simple. We allocate a new array of equal size to the input array. Then after that, we iterate through the array by two. We have two pointers, one pointing to the `x's`, and one pointing to the `y's`. As we iterate through the array, we place those in the desired spots, then return the array. The memory cost and runtime cost are both `O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] shuffle(int[] nums, int n) {

        int[] shuffled = new int[nums.length];
        
        int i, j, k;
        i = 0;
        j = n;
        
        for (k = 0; k < nums.length; k += 2)
        {
            shuffled[k] = nums[i];
            shuffled[k + 1] = nums[j];
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        
        return shuffled;
    }
}
```
