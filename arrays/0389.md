## Description

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

## Java Sorting

So this solution is effectively, just sorting the input strings. That way we can tell the different character via iterating through both input strings, and the first character that doesn't matched will be the desired character. The runtime cost which comes from sorting and the linear iteration is `O(2*(log(n)*n) + log(n)) -> O(n*log(n))`, and the memory cost which comes from the two new char[] arrays is `O(2*n) -> O(n)`:

```
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int i;
        char[] sSorted = s.toCharArray();
        char[] tSorted = t.toCharArray();
        
        Arrays.sort(sSorted);
        Arrays.sort(tSorted);
        
        for (i = 0; i < sSorted.length; i++) {
            if (sSorted[i] != tSorted[i]) return tSorted[i];
        }
        
        return tSorted[i];
    }
}
```
