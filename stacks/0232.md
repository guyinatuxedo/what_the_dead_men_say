## Description

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

```
    push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
    pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
    peek() -- Get the front element.
    empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
```

## Java Two Stacks

This was my original solution to this problem. For it, I have two stacks. Whenever I push an element onto the queue, I would add it to the first stack. Whenever I needed to pop/peek an element, I would pop all items from the first stack into the second stack, then grab the top element since the order was reversed, then return the elements to the original stack. To check if it was empty, I just needed to check if the first stack was empty.

The runtime for a `push` operation is order `O(1)`. The `peek/pop` operations are `O(2 * n)` -> `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the queue, since I pop all of the elments off from stack0 to stack1, then back again. The `isEmpty` operation is `O(1)`. The memory cost is `O(n)`, since both queues together will always have `n` elements.

```
class MyQueue {
    // Our two stacks
    private Stack<Integer> stack0;
    private Stack<Integer> stack1;
    
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyQueue() {
        stack0 = new Stack<>();
        stack1 = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    public void push(int x) {
        stack0.add(x);
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        int retVal;
        
        // Pop all items from stack0 to stack1
        while (!stack0.isEmpty())
        {
            stack1.add(stack0.pop());
        }
        
        // pop top value from stack1
        retVal = stack1.pop();
        
        // Return elements to stack1
        while (!stack1.isEmpty())
        {
            stack0.add(stack1.pop());
        }
        
        return retVal;
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    public int peek() {
        int retVal;
        
        // Pop all items from stack0 to stack1
        while (!stack0.isEmpty())
        {
            stack1.add(stack0.pop());
        }
        
        // peek top value from stack1
        retVal = stack1.peek();
        
        // Return elements to stack1
        while (!stack1.isEmpty())
        {
            stack0.add(stack1.pop());
        }        
        return retVal;
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return (stack0.isEmpty());
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyQueue obj = new MyQueue();
 * obj.push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj.pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.peek();
 * boolean param_4 = obj.empty();
 */
```

## Java Two Stacks Optimized

This solution is an optimized one from leetcode. It's similar to the above solution that it uses two stacks, and pops values from one to the other in order to reverse it. It differs from the above one, that it does this far less than the above one.

It works like this. When it adds items to the queue, it appends them to the first stack. Then when it goes to pop a value from the queue, it checks it does so from the second stack. before it does, it checks if it is empty, and if it is it pops all the values from the first stack over to the second. When it does this, the first item on the stack was the first item inserted into the data structure, so it will always be the first one out (same thing with the second, and third). So until the second stack runs out, we won't need to dump more values from stack1 to it.

Also for the `peek` operation, if stack 0 is empty, then we need to store the first item inserted in a variable, in case if when we go to peek, the second stack is empty.

For checking if it is empty, we will need to check both stacks.

The memory cost for this algorithm is still `O(n)`. The runtime cost for `emptry/peek/push` is `O(1)`. For `pop` the worst case runtime is `O(n)` when we need to refill it, but the average and bestcase scenario runtime is `O(1)`.

```
class MyQueue {
    // Our two stacks
    private Stack<Integer> stack0;
    private Stack<Integer> stack1;
    int first;
    
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MyQueue() {
        stack0 = new Stack<>();
        stack1 = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    /** Push element x to the back of queue. */
    public void push(int x) {
        if (stack0.isEmpty())
            first = x;
        stack0.add(x);
    }
    
    /** Removes the element from in front of queue and returns that element. */
    public int pop() {
        if (stack1.isEmpty())
        {
            while (!stack0.isEmpty())
            {
                stack1.add(stack0.pop());
            }
        }
        
        return stack1.pop();
    }
    
    /** Get the front element. */
    public int peek() {
        
        if (!stack1.isEmpty())
        {
            return stack1.peek();
        }
        
        return first;
    }
    
    /** Returns whether the queue is empty. */
    public boolean empty() {
        return (stack0.isEmpty() && stack1.isEmpty());
    }
}

/**
