## Java Hashset

So my solution for this utilizes two passes. The purpose of the first pass is to populate a hashSet will all of the "source" cities. Then with the second pass, I just check to see what "destination" city isn't a source city via checking if it exists in the hashset.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(2n)` -> `O(n)`, because of the two linear passes through the input. The memory cost is `O(x)` where `x` is the number of city pairs, because of the hashMap.

```
class Solution {
    public String destCity(List<List<String>> paths) {
        // Our hashset and working string we will use
        HashSet<String> source = new HashSet();
        String working = null;
        
        // Populate hashset with "source" cities
        for (int i = 0; i < paths.size(); i++)
        {
            working = paths.get(i).get(0);
            source.add(working);
        }
        
        // Iterate through again
        // See what destination city 
        // isn't in the hashset
        for (int i = 0; i < paths.size(); i++)
        {
            working = paths.get(i).get(1);
            if (!working.contains(working)) return working;
        }
        
        // If we got here, something's wrong
        return working;
    }
}
```
