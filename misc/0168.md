## Description

Given a positive integer, return its corresponding column title as appear in an Excel sheet.

```
    1 -> A
    2 -> B
    3 -> C
    ...
    26 -> Z
    27 -> AA
    28 -> AB 
    ...
```

## Java Decode Digit

This was my first solution to this problem. Looking at the description, it looks like there is a pattern behind the number to letter conversion. That is we take the number, mod it by `26` which gives us the next least significant letter. Then we divide the number by `26` to move on to the next letter. My code here basically replicates that pattern.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(l)` where `l` is the number of letters in the output string. This is because the loop runs once per letter. The memory cost is also `O(l)` because of the output string.

```
class Solution 
{
    // Our char mapping
    char[] mapping = {
        'A',
        'B',
        'C',
        'D',
        'E',
        'F',
        'G',
        'H',
        'I',
        'J',
        'K',
        'L',
        'M',
        'N',
        'O',
        'P',
        'Q',
        'R',
        'S',
        'T',
        'U',
        'V',
        'W',
        'X',
        'Y',
        'Z'                
    };
    
    public String convertToTitle(int n) 
    {
        int x;
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Iterate through all of the characters
        while (n > 0)
        {
            // Decrement input by one to
            // move value within array index
            n -= 1;
            
            // Grab the character for this iteration
            x = n % 26;
            
            // Decrement the input value to move to next character
            n /= 26;
            
            // Add the character to the string
            output.append(mapping[x]);
        }
        
        return output.reverse().toString();
    }
}
