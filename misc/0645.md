## Java HashSet & Summation

This was my first solution to this problem. There are two seperate problems here. The first is finding the missing number, the second is finding a duplicate number. For finding the duplicate, I use a HashSet, and as I iterate through the input array I check if each integer has been seen before. For finding the missing value, I calculate the summation of all numbers from 1 to n with no missing numbers. Then every value I subtract (except for the duplicate) from that summation, and the remainning value will be the missing number.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we iterate through the input array. The memory cost is also `O(n)` since we insert every number except the duplicate into a hashSet.

```
class Solution 
{
    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) 
    {
        HashSet<Integer> foundNums = new HashSet<Integer>();    
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int sum = (n + 1)*(n) / 2;

        int repeated = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            if (foundNums.contains(nums[i])) repeated = nums[i];
            else
            {
                foundNums.add(nums[i]);
                sum -= nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        int[] output = new int[2];
        output[0] = repeated;
        output[1] = sum;
        return output; 
    }
}
