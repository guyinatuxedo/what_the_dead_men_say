## Description

Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value to be inserted into the tree, insert the value into the BST. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

Note that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return any of them.

## Java Recursive Insertion

So this was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is, we insert the nodes as leaf nodes. So we will recursively make calls until we find a node, where we can insert it as a node into an empty child spot.

The runtime cost for this algorithm ranges somewhere between `O(n)` to `O(log(n))`, depending on how balanced the binary treee is. The memory cost for it is the same, because of the recursive calls.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

            // Spot we can insert it

        if (root != null) insertion(root, val);
