## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

## Java Recursive

So this solution I made here works off of recursion. The idea behind it is this. We make recursive calls down the tree. As we do so, we do two things. The first is we check if each of the node's values are within the permitted range for that particular spot. The second is we update the bounds for the future recursive calls based on the value of this node. We update the values based on two roles. All nodes to the left of a node, must have a value less than that node. All nodes to the right of a node, must have a value greater than that node (so for heading left we update `max`, for heading right we update `min`). In addition to that, as we start the algorithm we set the `min/max` values equal to a predefined constant, that means that that limit doesn't exist. This is because when we start at the root, there aren't any bounds which would make it invalid. If we were to traverse from the root always going right, only the `min` value would be updated, there wouldn't be a `max`.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we make a recursive call for every node in the tree. The memory cost which stems from the maximum call stack is equal to `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the binary tree. This can range from `O(n)` (binary tree devolved to linked list) to `O(log(n))` (perfectly balanced tree).

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    // A constant to represent bound not set
    private static final int notSet = -2643;
    
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        // Run Recursive Function
        return checkNode(root, notSet, notSet);
    }
    
    public boolean checkNode(TreeNode node, int min, int max) {
        // If node is null, this path is true
        if (node == null) return true;
        
        // Check if it is not within the bound
        if (node.val <= min && min != notSet) {
            return false;
        }
            
        if (node.val >= max && max != notSet) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check left/right children paths
        boolean leftCheck, rightCheck;
        
        leftCheck = checkNode(node.left, min, node.val);
        rightCheck = checkNode(node.right, node.val, max);
        
        return leftCheck && rightCheck;
    }
}
```

## Java Iterative

So this is the second solution I came up with. The idea is to use iteration instead of recursion. Now this poses a bit more of a challenging situation. This is because each node's bounds are different, since every node has different parents. And since we recurse, we jump from one sub-branch to another. We solve this through the use of lists. As we iterate through the tree, we push a node's children onto the list. As we do that, we also push the bounds for that child onto separate lists. For the stack, a node and it's bounds will be placed at the same spot, so when we take a node, and a `max/min` value at the same spot, they are all for the same node. If we end up at a child that is null, we just continue to the next spot in the queue. When the linked list is empty, we know that we have iterated through the entire tree and that it is valid. The rules for updating the bounds, and the initial no-bounds are the same as the above solution.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` because we have to look at every node. The memory cost is `O(3n)` -> `O(n)` because of the three linked lists.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private LinkedList<Integer> maxs = new LinkedList<Integer>();
    private LinkedList<Integer> mins = new LinkedList<Integer>();
    private LinkedList<TreeNode> nodes = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
    
    // A constant to represent bound not set
    private static final int notSet = -2643;
    
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        
        int currentMax, currentMin;
        TreeNode currentNode;
        
        if (root == null) return true;
        
        nodes.add(root);
        maxs.add(notSet);
        mins.add(notSet);
        
        while (!nodes.isEmpty()) {
            currentNode = nodes.poll();
            currentMax = maxs.poll();
            currentMin = mins.poll();
            
            if (currentNode == null) continue;
            
            if (currentNode.val >= currentMax && currentMax != notSet) return false;
            if (currentNode.val <= currentMin && currentMin != notSet) return false;
            
            nodes.add(currentNode.right);
            maxs.add(currentMax);
            mins.add(currentNode.val);
            
            nodes.add(currentNode.left);
            maxs.add(currentNode.val);
            mins.add(currentMin);
        }
        
        return true;
    }

}
```

## Java Inorder

This solution was from leetcode. The idea here is to use the Inorder traversal of a tree to determine if it is valid. This is because the Inorder traversal should list the numbers in the increasing order, if it is valid. For example:

```
                5
            /       \
            3        7
            /\      /\
        1       4   6   8

Inorder Traversal:  1 3 4 5 6 7 8
Inorder Path: Left->Root->Right
```

So to do this, we utilize a stack. We iterate as far left as we can, adding the values to the stack. We have a value that specifies the last seen value, which is initialized to the min Double value. After we do the check. The new value will be the first value on the stack. We check the value against the inorder. If it passes, we move onto the right child of the current node.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, since we visit every node. The memory cost is also `O(n)` because of the stack.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {   
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack();
        double inorder = - Double.MAX_VALUE;
        
        while (!stack.isEmpty() || root != null) {
            while (root != null) {
                stack.push(root);
                root = root.left;
            }
            
            root = stack.pop();
            if (root.val <= inorder) return false;
            inorder = root.val;
            root = root.right;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
