## Description

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

## Java Recursive

This is my recursive solution to this challenge. The idea behind it is, we recurse down the tree, keeping track of the depth as we descend the tree. When we hit a leaf node, we return the depth. For nodes with children, we return the minimum depth of the left/right subtrees. For null nodes, we return a really large value, so the min selection will discard it. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we make a recursive call once per node of the tree. The memory cost is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree, which comes from the recursive calls.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        // Check for empty input
        if (root == null) return 0;
        
        // Recurse down the tree
        return recurseMinDepth(root, 1);
    }
    
    private int recurseMinDepth(TreeNode working, int currentDepth) {
        // If node is null, we can't recurse any longer
        if (working == null) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // If node is leaf node, return the depth
        if (working.left == null && working.right == null) return currentDepth;
        
        // Return the minimum depth, of either the left/right subtrees
        int leftDepth, rightDepth;
        
        leftDepth = recurseMinDepth(working.left, currentDepth + 1);
        rightDepth = recurseMinDepth(working.right, currentDepth + 1);
        
        return Math.min(leftDepth, rightDepth);
    }
}
```

## Java Iterative

This is the iterative solution to this challenge. It revolves around having linked lists, which store the nodes/depths (the depth at index `x` in the depths linked list is for the node at index `x` in the nodes linked list). Every time we add a node, we add the corresponding depths, which is `+1` the depth of the parent node. Much like the recursive solution, whenever we reach a leaf node, we update the minimum depth if it needs to be. The algorithm is pretty similar to the recursive solution, just uses iteration instead of recursion. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost which comes from the linked lists is `O(2n) -> O(n)`.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        // Check for empty input
        if (root == null) return 0;
        
        // Our linked lists for storage
        LinkedList<TreeNode> nodes = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
        LinkedList<Integer> depths = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        
        // Add root to the start of the list
        nodes.add(root);
        depths.add(1);
        
        TreeNode currentNode;
        int currentDepth, minDepth;
        
        // Initialize mindepth to large value
        minDepth = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        while (!nodes.isEmpty()) {
            // Get the current node / corresponding depth
            currentNode = nodes.poll();
            currentDepth = depths.poll();
            
            // If null, there is nothing to do
            if (currentNode == null) continue;
            
            // If leaf node, update mindepth if needed
            if (currentNode.left == null && currentNode.right == null) {
                minDepth = Math.min(currentDepth, minDepth);
            }
            
            // Not leaf node, add children to linked list
            else {
                nodes.add(currentNode.left);
                nodes.add(currentNode.right);
                depths.add(currentDepth + 1);
                depths.add(currentDepth + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return minDepth;
    }
    

}
```

## Recursive C

So for this algorithm, we have to find the minimum depth, which is the minimum distance between the root and a leaf node. For my algorithm, we first check if the root is null (since if it is, it can already have one depth). Then we begin the recursive calls. For the recursive calls, there are realistically three cases. One of which is that both children are null, in which they have reached a leaf node and report it's depth. The next case is where we have one null child, and one non null child, in which case we just continue searching for the depth down the non-null path and return it. The final case is where we have two non-null children, in which case we grab the minimum depth of both the branches, and return the lesser of the two.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, since this algorithm will have to look at every node once (`n` is the number of nodes in the tree). The worst possible memory cost is also `O(n)` since the memory allocation primarily comes from the stack variables of each recursive function call, which happens for each node that isn't the root. However if the tree is balanced, a memory cost of `O(log(n))` can be reached if the tree is balanced. This is due to the fact that our algorithm is a depth first search, so if the tree is balanced that means that there is less memory needed at one particular time (the reason for the `log(n)` as the reduced size comes from the characteristics of a balanced bst).

 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;

int getMinDepthRecursive(struct TreeNode* node, int depth)
{
    int leftDepth, rightDepth;
    
    // If both children are null, we have reached a leaf node
    if ((node->right == NULL) && (node->left == NULL))
    {
        return depth;    
    }
    
    // If either of these checks are true, one child is null and the other isn't
    // So we only need to check one branch

    if ((node->right == NULL))
    {
        
        leftDepth = getMinDepthRecursive(node->left, depth + 1);
        return leftDepth;
    }
   
    if ((node->left == NULL))
    {
        rightDepth = getMinDepthRecursive(node->right, depth + 1);
        return rightDepth;
    }

    // This is for when both children are not null
    // Check the length of both child branches, return the lesser

    leftDepth = getMinDepthRecursive(node->left, depth + 1);
    rightDepth = getMinDepthRecursive(node->right, depth + 1);
    
    if (leftDepth < rightDepth)
    {
        return leftDepth;
    }
    
    return rightDepth;
}

int minDepth(struct TreeNode* root){
    
    int leftDepth, rightDepth;
    
    // If the root is null, the only depth is 0
    if (root == NULL)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Recurively grab the minimum length
    return getMinDepthRecursive(root, 1);
}
```
