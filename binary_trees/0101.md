## Description:

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```
 

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:

```
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```

## Java Recursive

So the idea behind this solution revolves around this. With the exception of the root node (since it's in the middle, it can be whatever value) in order for the tree to be symmetrical, every node must be equal to its counterpart on the other side. So every node must be checked against one other node on the other side of the tree. So we recurse down the tree, checking each time if two nodes are equal. Now since they are opposites, if we go to the left on one side for a node, we go to the right on the other side, and vice versa,

The runtime behind this algorithm is `O(n/2)` -> `O(n)` because we make `n/2` recursive calls. The memory cost of this algorithm scales directly with the height of the binary tree (because of the recursive call stack), which in the best case is `O(log(n))` (perfectly balanced tree) and in the worst case is `O(n)` (tree has devolved into linked list).

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        // Check for empty input
        if (root == null) return true;
        
        // Check the tree
        return recursiveCheck(root.left, root.right);
        
    }
    
    private boolean recursiveCheck(TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        // If both nodes are null, this part is symmetrical
        if (left == null && right == null) return true;
        
        // If only one node is null, this part is not symmetrical
        if (left == null || right == null) return false;
        
        // If values are not equal, tree is not symmetrical
        if (left.val != right.val) return false;
        
        // Check the children of the two nodes
        return recursiveCheck(left.right, right.left) & recursiveCheck(left.left, right.right);
    }
}
```

## Java Iterative

So this solution revolves around the same principle as the above one. The difference is, we use iteration to check the tree instead of recursion. We append the nodes to be checked to a linked list, with nodes to be checked against each other being stored adjacent. How we check it is the same.

The runtime is the same as the above one with an `O(n)` runtime. The memory cost however becomes `O(n)` because of the linked list used to store the nodes.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        // Check for empty input
        if (root == null) return true;
        
        // Create linked list for nodes
        LinkedList<TreeNode> nodes = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
        
        // Add the first two nodes to be checked
        nodes.add(root.left);
        nodes.add(root.right);
        
        // Helper nodes for checking
        TreeNode left, right;
        
        // Iterate through entire tree
        while (!nodes.isEmpty()) {
            // Pick next two nodes to be checked
            left = nodes.poll();
            right = nodes.poll();
            
            // If both nodes are null, these two nodes are symmetrical
            if (left == null && right == null) continue;
            
            // If only one node is null, these two nodes aren't symmetrical
            if (left == null || right == null) return false;
            
            // Check if values are symmetrical
            if (left.val != right.val) return false;
            
            // Add children to linked list, to be checked
            nodes.add(left.left);
            nodes.add(right.right);
            nodes.add(left.right);
            nodes.add(right.left);
        }
        
        // Iterated through tree, it is symmetrical
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Solution - Recursively C

Below is the source code for this solution. We start off by running a series of checks on the root node, to ensure that it's worth starting to recursively make calls down the rest of the tree. The process of verifying nodes is simple. First off we check for nulls. If the nulls are not symmetrical, then there is no way the tree can be symmetrical. If the nulls are symmetrical, we know that piece of the tree is symmetrical. Proceeding that, we check if the values of the nodes are equal. If so, we continue checking for a symmetrical tree. When we check a subsequent layer of the tree, we check the opposite ends of each side, since they are the ones that need to be equal in order for the tree to be symmetrical.

This algorithm has an O(n) time and space complexity. The time complexity comes that in order for this algorithm to verify that a tree is symmetrical, it needs to look at each node once. The space complexity comes from the fact that the number of function calls made directly scales with the number of nodes in the tree. The more nodes in the tree, the more function calls are made, which results in more memory used (assuming that the algorithm doesn't exit out beforehand due to an unsymmetrical tree).

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;
 * };
 */

bool checkNodes(struct TreeNode * left, struct TreeNode * right)
{

    // Check if children are null
    if ((left == NULL) && (right == NULL))
    {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if the node is missing one child
    if ((left == NULL) || (right == NULL))
    {
        return false;
    }    
    
    // Check if the node's children are equal
    if ((left->val != right->val))
    {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Run the algorithm recursively across the rest
    return checkNodes(left->left, right->right) && checkNodes(left->right, right->left);
}

bool isSymmetric(struct TreeNode* root)
{
    // Check if root is null
    if (root == NULL)
    {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if the children of root is null
    if ((root->left == NULL) && (root->right == NULL))
    {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Check if a single child of root is null
    if ((root->left == NULL) || (root->right == NULL))
    {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if the children of root are equal
    if ((root->left->val == root->right->val))
    {
        // Recursively Check the rest of the nodes in the tree
        return checkNodes(root->left, root->right);
    }
    
    // If the code hits here, it can't possibly be symmetric
    return false;
}
```

## Python3 Iterative

So this solution utilizes a stack to iterate through a tree. We start off by checking if the root is None, and if so it's balanced. Then we initialize the stack, and append the children of the root to the stack, and begin iterating through the tree.

The stack contains all of the nodes that need to be analyzes, so when the stack is empty we have analyzed the entire tree. Each iteration of the loop will look at two nodes, which are opposite each other (since in order for the tree to be balanced, these two nodes will have the same value). The first check is if they are both None, since if they are this part of the tree is balanced. Then after that we check if either node is None, since if one is None and one isn't, then it isn't balanced. Then we check if the values are equal, and if they are this part of the tree is balanced. Proceeding that we append the children of those two nodes to the stack. We append the opposite children, that way the stack is structured in a way where the two nodes that must be equal in order for the tree to be symmetrical are right next to each other in the stack. This algorithm will iterate through all of the nodes of one level, before proceeding to the next level.

The runtime requirement is `O(n)`, since the number of loop iterations directly scales with the number of nodes in a linear fashion. The major space requirement comes from the stack, which the space that takes up also directly scales with the number of nodes. As such the space complexity is `O(n)`

```
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if root == None:
            return True
        
        stack = []
        
        stack.append(root.left)
        stack.append(root.right)
        
        while stack != []:
            # Pop off the first two elements
            left = stack.pop()
            right = stack.pop()
            
            # If both are none, this part is balanced
            if (left == right == None):
                continue
            
            # If only one node is none, tree is not balanced
            if (left == None) or (right == None):
                return False
            
            # If the node values are not equal, not balanced
            if (left.val != right.val):
                return False
            
            # Add the children to the stack
            stack.append(left.left)
            stack.append(right.right)
            
            stack.append(left.right)
            stack.append(right.left)
        
        # Iterated through entire tree, so it's balanced
        return True
```
