## Java Iteration

This was my original solution to this problem. The idea behind this is we iterate through each level of the binary tree, setting the next ptrs. We store the current level in one queue, and the next lvel in another queue. As we iterate through a level, we check if there are children, and if there are we add them to the `nextLevel` queue. Upon reaching the end of a level, we just move on to the next level.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The memory cost however is `O(x)` where `x` is the size in nodes of the largest level. This is because that queue will be larger by a factor of `2` (or more) than every other level. However since this is a perfect binary tree `x` will be `n/2`.

// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node next;

    public Node() {}
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    public Node(int _val, Node _left, Node _right, Node _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;
    }
};

class Solution {
    // Helper function to add children to queue
    private void addChildren(Queue<Node> level, Node x)
    {
            if (x.left != null)
            {
                level.add(x.left);
                level.add(x.right);
            }        
    }
    
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        // Check for a null root
        if (root == null) return root;
        
        // Check for a root with no children
        if ((root.left == null) || (root.right == null)) return root;
        
        // Create our two queues, one for the current level
        // one for the next level
        Queue<Node> currentLevel = new LinkedList<Node>();
        Queue<Node> nextLevel = new LinkedList<Node>();  
        
        // Initialize current level with root's kids
        currentLevel.add(root.left);
        currentLevel.add(root.right);
          
        Node x, y;
        while (!currentLevel.isEmpty())
        {
            // Set this level equal to the next
            nextLevel = new LinkedList<Node>();

            // Grab the first element from this queue
            x = currentLevel.poll();
            while (!currentLevel.isEmpty())
            {
                // Grab the next element, set the next ptrs
                y = currentLevel.poll();
                x.next = y;
                
                // Add the children to the next level
                addChildren(nextLevel, x);
                x = y;
            }
            // Process the last node
            x.next = null;
            addChildren(nextLevel, x);
            
            // Set the current level equal to the next level
            currentLevel = nextLevel;
        }
        return root;
    }
}

## Java

This is a more optimized solution than my original, from leetcode. It's a similar idea to the above solution, where we iterate through the tree each level. However the difference is that we utilize the next pointers. In addition to that, when we iterate through a level, we are setting the ptrs for the children of the level. Since we start at the root (which has it's next ptr set) this isn't an issue.

So there are two cases we need to worry about when setting the next ptr for the children. The first is when we have a parent node with two children, and we just set the left child's next ptr to the right, which is pretty simple. The other instance is when we need to set the right child's ptr to the left child of the next parent node. For this, we can leverage the next ptr for the parent node that was set in the previous level's pass. We can just first check if the parent has a next ptr. Then if it does, set the right child's next pointer, to the left child of the next parent over.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes. The memory cost however is `O(1)`, since we just use a static amount of variables, with static size.

        val = _val;
    }

    public Node(int _val, Node _left, Node _right, Node _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;

        // Start leftmost as root
        leftmost = root;
   
        // Iterate through the entire tree
