## Description

Invert a binary tree.

## Java Recursive

This was my first solution to this problem. Effectively I just swap the children, and make a recursive call to the children. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes. The memory cost is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the binary trees, which comes from the max number of recursive calls.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution 
{
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root)
    {
        TreeNode tmp;

        // Check for null input
        if (root == null) return null;
        
        // Swap the children
        tmp = root.left;
        root.left = root.right;
        root.right = tmp;
        
        // Make recursive calls to the children
        invertTree(root.left);
        invertTree(root.right);
        
        return root;    
    }
}
```

## Java Iterative

This was my second solution to this problem. It is pretty similar to the above one, but I use iteration instead. I store the nodes in a Queue. The runtime cost is still `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(n)`.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution 
{
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root)
    {
        TreeNode tmp, working;

        // Check for null input
        if (root == null) return null;
        
        // Our linked list which stores all of the nodes
        Queue<TreeNode> nodes = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
        
        // Add the root node as the first node
        nodes.add(root);
        
        // Iterate through all of the nodes
        while (!nodes.isEmpty())
        {
            // Grab the next node
            working = nodes.poll();
            
            // Swap the children
            tmp = working.left;
            working.left = working.right;
            working.right = tmp;
         
            // Add the children
            if (working.left != null) nodes.add(working.left);
            if (working.right != null) nodes.add(working.right);
        }
        
        return root;    
    }
}
```
