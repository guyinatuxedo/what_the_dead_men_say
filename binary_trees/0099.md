## Description

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

## Java Recursive

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind this solution is this. I make recursive calls down the tree, with the parameters being the range of values which the node must be in to be valid. If it isn't within that range, I return the node value, then swap it's value with the parent. If it is valid, then I return a specified constant. Now to deal with instances where I need to swap mulitple values (since I only swap a parent value with a direct child's value), I will call this algorithm multiple times, untill no swaps are made.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is around `O(n * r)` where `n` is the number of nodes, and `r` is the amount of swaps that happen. The memory cost which comes from the recursive calls is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the binary tree.

 *     TreeNode() {}

 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }

    public int recurse(int max, int min, TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return -1;
        
        if (max <= node.val || min >= node.val && node.val != Integer.MIN_VALUE) {
            // Found the invalid node
            return node.val;
        }
        
        int x, y;
        x = recurse( max, node.val, node.right);
        y = recurse( node.val, min, node.left);

        if (x == -2 || y == -2) return -2;
        
        if (x != -1) {
            node.right.val = node.val;

    public void recoverTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        int x = -2;
        while (x == -2) {
            x = recurse(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, root);
        }
    }
