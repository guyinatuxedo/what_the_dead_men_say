## Description

```
Given a binary tree

struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.
```

## Java Iterative Queues

For this problem is a part 2 to an earlier problem. Turns out my solution to the first part, when slightly modified solved this one too, which is what this is.

So the main difference between the first and second part, is that we can no longer assume that the input tree is a perfectly balanced tree. To adapt the previous algorithm to meet this, all we need to do is add a check for both children being null before adding them, and modifying the check to see if root's children are null.



```
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node next;

    public Node() {}
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    public Node(int _val, Node _left, Node _right, Node _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;
    }
};

class Solution {
    // Helper function to add children to queue
    private void addChildren(Queue<Node> level, Node x)
    {
            if (x.left != null)
            {
                level.add(x.left);
            }        
            if (x.right != null)
            {
                level.add(x.right);
            }
    }
    
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        // Check for a null root
        if (root == null) return root;
        
        // Check for a root with no children
        if ((root.left == null) && (root.right == null)) return root;
        
        // Create our two queues, one for the current level
        // one for the next level
        Queue<Node> currentLevel = new LinkedList<Node>();
        Queue<Node> nextLevel = new LinkedList<Node>();  
        
        // Initialize current level with root's kids
        addChildren(currentLevel, root);
          
        Node x, y;
        while (!currentLevel.isEmpty())
        {
            // Set this level equal to the next
            nextLevel = new LinkedList<Node>();

            // Grab the first element from this queue
            x = currentLevel.poll();
            while (!currentLevel.isEmpty())
            {
                // Grab the next element, set the next ptrs
                y = currentLevel.poll();
                x.next = y;
                
                // Add the children to the next level
                addChildren(nextLevel, x);
                x = y;
            }
            // Process the last node
            x.next = null;
            addChildren(nextLevel, x);
            
            // Set the current level equal to the next level
            currentLevel = nextLevel;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

## Java Nxt Pointers

This is similar to the previous ptrs solution. The idea behind how we modified this algorithm, first off, when we start iterating through one level to look at the children, we clear out the leftmost ptr. While we are looking at the children, if a child is null, we skip it. If it isn't null, then we save it in `prev`. When we get to a child node, and `prev` isn't null, then we set `prev.next` equal to the current node, since it is the next node in the level. Also if leftmost is null, we set the child equal to that. For the purpose of this algorithm, it's main purpose is to tell us when we're done (since all children at that level will be null, it wouldn't be set to anything), as well as we're we start iterating through a level.

```
class Solution {
    
    Node prev, leftmost;
    
    private void processChild(Node x)
    {
        // If node is null, ignore it
        if (x == null) return;
        
        // This is the first child node on this level
        if (prev == null)
        {
            leftmost = x;
        }
        
        // Set the connection to the previous node
        else
        {
            prev.next = x;
        }
        
        prev = x;
    }
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        
        // Check for a null root
        if (root == null) return root;

        // Where our algorithm starts
        this.leftmost = root;
        
        // Iterate through each level
        while (leftmost != null)
        {
            // Establish the firts node on this level
            Node working = leftmost;
            
            // Reset our ptrs
            leftmost = null;
            prev = null;
            
            // Iterate through each node of this level
            while (working != null)
            {
                // Add the children, move on to next node
                processChild(working.left);
                processChild(working.right);
                working = working.next;
            }
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```
