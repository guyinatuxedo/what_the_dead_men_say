## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
```
    a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.
```

## Java Iteration

This is similar to the Java Recursive solution, and many of the other Binary Tree Iterative solutions. We iterate through the tree with two linked lists, one which stores the nodes and one the corresponding path sums. When we get to leaf nodes, we check if the sum is equal to the target, and if so return true.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`. The memory cost which stems from the linked lists is also `O(n)`.

```

 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;

 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {

class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {     
        LinkedList<TreeNode> nodes = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
        LinkedList<Integer> sums = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        
        nodes.add(root);
        sums.add(0);
        
        TreeNode currentNode;
        int currentSum, newSum;
        
        while (!nodes.isEmpty()) {
            currentNode = nodes.poll();
            currentSum = sums.poll();
            
            if (currentNode == null) continue;
            
            newSum = currentSum + currentNode.val;
            
            if (currentNode.left == null && currentNode.right == null) {
                if (newSum == sum) return true;
                continue;
            }
            
            nodes.add(currentNode.left);
            nodes.add(currentNode.right);
            sums.add(newSum);
            sums.add(newSum);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Java Recursive

This is a recursive solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We recurse down the tree, calculating the path as we go. If the path is equal to the sum when we hit a leaf node (we check this via subtraction), we know there is a valid path.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`. The memory cost for this algorithm which comes from a recursive call stack is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the binary tree.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {     
        // Recurse down tree
        return checkRecursive(root, sum);
    }
    
    public boolean checkRecursive(TreeNode node, int remainder) {
        // Null nodes cannot be leaf nodes
        if (node == null) return false;
        
        // If leaf node, check if it equal the desired sum
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            return (remainder - node.val == 0);
        }
        
        boolean left, right;
        int newRemainder = remainder - node.val;
        
        // Check if there are valid leaf nodes on left/right child branches
        left = checkRecursive(node.left, newRemainder);
        right = checkRecursive(node.right, newRemainder);
        
        return left | right;
    }
}
```

## C Recursive Backtracking

So for this problem, we have to see if there exists a path (a string of nodes from the root node to a leaf node) that the sum of all of the nodes is equal to a value. First off I check if the root is null, since if it's null there are no paths, so we know it's false. After that, we start making recursive calls of `getPathSum()`. This will traverse the tree starting with the left-most nodes, adding the values together as we go along. Once we reach a leaf node, we see if the summation is equal to three (and if so, we return true). If not we backtrack to the previous node, and try traversing down the right path.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)` in the worst case, since this algorithm will have to look at every node (one recursive call per node). The memory cost can range from `O(n)` to `O(log(n))`. Since the memory cost is mainly associated with the memory of the recursive calls, the memory cost directly scales with the number of the size of the call stack. In the best case the bst is balanced, since that will end up with the shortest call stack (`O(log(n))`). The worst case is when the tree is not balanced at all, which will lead to the largest call stack.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;
 * };
 */

bool getPathSum(struct TreeNode* node, int summation, int key)
{
    
    // Check the left side first
    if (node->left != NULL)
    {
        if (getPathSum(node->left, summation + node->val, key) == true)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    // Backtrack to the right side
    if (node->right != NULL)
    {
        if (getPathSum(node->right, summation + node->val, key) == true)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    // Check if we reached a leaf node
    if (((node->right == node->left ) && (node->right == NULL) )
    {
        // Check if the path sum is equal to the desired value
        if (summation + node->val) == key)
        {
            // We found the path
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    // Not this path
    return false;
    
}

bool hasPathSum(struct TreeNode* root, int sum){
    // If the root node is null, there's no
    // possible path to reach a constant
    if (root == NULL)
    {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Recursively find the path
    return canFind = getPathSum(root, 0, sum);
}
