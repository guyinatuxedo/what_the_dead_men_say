## Description

Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

## Java Recursion BackTracking

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind my solution is this. I make recursive through the tree. As I do this I maintain a list of the current integers that make up the path. When I reach a leaf node, I check if the current sum of the path meets the target value, and if it does, I make a new list and append it to the output. Also as I am done recursing through the children, I remove that value from the array which stores the path, since I am done with that node.

The backtracking comes in with how after we travel down one path, we will backtrack to the last fork and traverse down the next path.

The worst runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n^2)`. The reason for this comes when we have a balanced binary tree, where we have `n/2` leaf nodes, and each leaf node is a valid path so we will have to copy it over which is another `O(n)` operation. The memory complexity does vary, however there are mainly three different things that affect it. The call stack for the recursive calls, the `current` list, and the `ouput` array.

        // since we have checked all the children
        current.remove(current.size() - 1);

    public List<List<Integer>> pathSum(TreeNode root, int sum)

        List<List<Integer>> output = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>();
        List<Integer> working = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        
        // Check if the tree is empty
        if (root == null) return output;
        
        // Recurse through the tre
        recurse(output, root, working, 0, sum);
