## Description

Given a binary tree, return the values of its boundary in anti-clockwise direction starting from root. Boundary includes left boundary, leaves, and right boundary in order without duplicate nodes.  (The values of the nodes may still be duplicates.)

Left boundary is defined as the path from root to the left-most node. Right boundary is defined as the path from root to the right-most node. If the root doesn't have left subtree or right subtree, then the root itself is left boundary or right boundary. Note this definition only applies to the input binary tree, and not applies to any subtrees.

The left-most node is defined as a leaf node you could reach when you always firstly travel to the left subtree if exists. If not, travel to the right subtree. Repeat until you reach a leaf node.

The right-most node is also defined by the same way with left and right exchanged.

## Java Iterative / Recursive

So the idea behind this solution was this. We break this problem down into three parts. We consider there to be three sides, like a triangle. We add the left side first. Then the bottom side. Then finally the right side.

To add the left side. We start with the root node. Then we start iterating through the left child of the root node (we start there since if we started at the root, it could spin off to the right side). We travel down the leftmost side of the binary tree, adding the values until we hit the leaves. Then to add the bottom side, we just recurse down the tree adding all of the leaves. Then to add the right side, we pretty much do what we did for the right side, except we add the values to a stack so we can reverse the values.
