## Description

Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the range [low, high].

## Java Recursion

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is we just recursively travel through the trees, adding the valid values to the sum. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost which comes from the recursive call stack is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        return recurse(root, low, high);
    }
    
    private int recurse(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        int val, sum;
        
        // Check for null node
        if (root == null) return 0;
        
        sum = 0;
        val = root.val;
        

        // Check if the left/right subtrees need to be traversed
        if (val >= low) {
            sum += recurse(root.left, low, high);
        }
        
        if (val <= high) {
            sum += recurse(root.right, low, high);
        }
        
        // Check if this node is in the range
        if ((val <= high) && (val >= low)) {
            return sum + val;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
    
}
```

## Java Iterative

So this is pretty much the same solution, it's just we iterate through the tree with a Stack. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(w)` where `w` is the maximum width of the tree, which can scale to a max of `n/2`, which comes from the stack:s

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        int sum = 0;
        TreeNode working;
        Stack<TreeNode> nodes = new Stack<TreeNode>();
        nodes.push(root);
        
        while (!nodes.isEmpty()) {
            working = nodes.pop();
            if (working == null) continue;
            if ((low <= working.val) && (working.val <= high)) {
                sum += working.val;
            }
            
            // Check if the left/right subtrees need to be traversed
            if (working.val >= low) {
                nodes.push(working.left);
            }
        
            if (working.val <= high) {           
                nodes.push(working.right);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
}
```
