## Description

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

## Java Recursion

So this is a pretty simple solution. We just recurse through the tree, searching for the value. The runtime cost is `O(n)`, and the memory cost which comes from the recursive call stack is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the binary tree.

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {       
        // Begin the recursion
        return recurseSearch(root, val);
    }
    
    private TreeNode recurseSearch(TreeNode node, int val) {
        // If this executes, tree doesn't have value
        if (node == null) return null;
        
        // This is the node
        if (node.val == val) return node;
        
        // Node is on the right subtree
        if (node.val < val) return recurseSearch(node.right, val);
        
        // Node is on the left subtree
        return recurseSearch(node.left, val);
    }
}
```

## Java Iterative

This is a beetter solution. This time, we iterate through the tree. Due to the desgin of a binary tree, we only need to keep track of one node at a time. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        TreeNode working;
        
        working = root;
        
        while (working != null) {           
            if (working.val == val) return working;
            
            if (working.val < val) working = working.right;
            else working = working.left;
        }
        
        return null;
    }

}
```
