## Description

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

    Search for a node to remove.
    If the node is found, delete the node.

## Solution Java Recursion

This solution is from leetcode.

So the idea behind this solution is this. To find the node to delete, we can just traverse the tree in the typical fashion. Once we find the node to delete, there are really three cases. The first which is the easiest to deal with, is if we have a leaf node with no children. In this instance, we can just set that node equal to null and move on. The second case is we reach a non-leaf node with children on the right. For this, we can effectively take the lowest node on the right, and move it to this spot. THe last case is where we reach a non-leaf node with children only on the left, which we will delete it by moving the greatest child on the left up to this spot.

So in terms of how we will accomplish this. We will make recursive calls through the tree. As we make the recursive calls down the path, we will be setting the nodes equal to what the recursive calls return. Because of this, if we reach a node to be deleted that is a leaf, we can just return zero. 

If we reach a node who has children, this is what will be done. First we will find the value of the node that will take this spot, and set it to that. Then we will go down and delete the node has been moved up. This is done so we can effectively deal with having to move a node up that has children.
