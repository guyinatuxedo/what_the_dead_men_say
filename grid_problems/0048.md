## Description

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

## Java Matrix Transpose / Row Reversal

So the idea behind this solution is this. We transpose the matrix, then reverse the rows. That will give us the desired behavior. This challenge was from leetcode, has an `O(1)` memory cost, and an `O(n^2)` runtime cost.

```
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        
        // Transpose the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                int tmp = matrix[j][i];
                matrix[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = tmp;
            }    
        }
        
        // Reverse each row
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n / 2; j++) {
                int tmp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[i][n - j - 1];
                matrix[i][n - j - 1] = tmp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
