## Description

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

```
    Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
    Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
```

## Java Linear Search Recursion w/ Memorization

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is pretty simple. We start at the spot at the cords `0, 0`. For each spot, we check if it is equal to, greater than, or less than the target. If it is equal to, then we return true to mark that we solved it. If it is greater than, then we return fals to mark that this path didn't work. If it is less than, and there are spots to the left and below the current one with numbers greater than or equal to the target, we will make a recursive call to those spots and or the answers together (that way the `return true` which marks success doesn't get lost). 

Now I also have a 2D array of booleans the size of the input matrix. The purpose of this is to mark if we've visited a node or not. Since with this algorithm once we visit a node, we don't have a need to visit it again (however it tends to attempt to visit the same node multiple times).

class Solution {
    private int n;
    private int m;
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        n = matrix.length;
        if (n == 0) return false;
        m = matrix[0].length;
        if (m == 0) return false;
        
        int i, j;
        
        i = j = 0;
        
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][m];
        
        for (boolean[] array : visited) {
            Arrays.fill(array, false);    
        }
        
        return hope(matrix, 0, 0, target, visited);
    }
    
    public boolean hope(int[][] matrix, int i, int j, int target, boolean[][] visited) {
        boolean x, y;
        
        if (visited[i][j] == true) return false;
        
        visited[i][j] = true;
        
        x = y = false;
        
        if (matrix[i][j] == target) return true;
        
        else if (matrix[i][j] < target) {
            if (i + 1 < n && matrix[i + 1][j] <= target) x = hope(matrix, i+1, j, target, visited);
            if (j + 1 < m && matrix[i][j + 1] <= target) y = hope(matrix, i, j+1, target, visited);
            return x | y;
        }
        
        else {
            return false;
        }
        
    }
    
    
}
