## Description

Given a matrix of m x n elements (m rows, n columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

## Java Matrix Iteration

So this was my first solution to this problem. This is the idea behind my solution.

So there are four directions we can travel in this matrix. For each direction we will either be changing the `x` or `y` coordinate by either `1` or `-1`. I store the direction in an integer, and use some int arrays to move the coordinates easily. The hard part comes from checking if our coordinates that we move have either gone outside of the boundary, or into an area we've already covered.

To check for this, we need to know three things. The first is the new coordinates. The second is the dimensions of the input matrix. The third is how many sides have already been covered. 

To check for this, I see if the current coordinate we are moving (either `x` or `y`) has reached either `0 + sidesCovered/2` (if we are decreasing the coordinate) or `length - sidesCovered/2`. This will tell us if we need to change direction, and if I do I change both the `x/y` coordinates to move us to the next spot. The reason why I need the `/2` is because when we add one side, it has to cycle over to the other side before we encounter that side again. Also after I make a pass through an `x` dimension side, I increment the `y` sides, and vice versa. That is because opposite passes are what decrease the amount we have to travel for the opposite dimension.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n * m)` which is the area of the matrix, since we have to look at each spot. The memory cost for this algorithm is also `O(n * m)` because of the output array.

        // and check for empty input
        n = matrix.length;
        if (n == 0) return outputNums;
        m = matrix[0].length;
        if (m == 0) return outputNums;

        boolean up = true;
