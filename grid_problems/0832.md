## Description

Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].

To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

## Java Iterate through 2D Array

So the idea behind my solution here is that I have a nested for loop. The outer loop iterates through each array in the matrix, and the inner loop iterates through half of each row. As it is iterating through the row, it swaps two elements, and inverts them. To invert the number, we can just xor it by `1` (since `0 ^ 1 == 1` and `1 ^ 1 == 0`). To save time, I just xor the swapped value as were writing it.

The runtime algorithm here is `O(m * m)` where `n/m` are the length/width of the matrix. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)` since we just modify the input array.

```
class Solution 
{
    public int[][] flipAndInvertImage(int[][] A) 
    {
        int tmp;
        
        if (A.length == 0) return A;
        int m = A[0].length;
        
        if (m == 0) return A;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < ((m + 1) / 2); j++)
            {
                tmp = A[i][j] ^ 1;
                A[i][j] = A[i][m - 1 - j] ^ 1;
                A[i][m - 1 - j] = tmp;
            }
        }
        
        return A;
    }
}
```
