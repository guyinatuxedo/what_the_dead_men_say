## Description

Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

## Java Iterative Slide Window

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind my solution is this. I iterate through each window. For each window, I check for the maximum, and write it to the output array. Then I move onto the next. At first I tried to write the output values to the input array, however there was an issue where the output array is shorter than the `nums` array.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(k * n)` where `n` is the number of numbers in the input array, and `k` is the size of the window. The reason for that is that we iterate through the input array, and check for a max int in the current window which takes `k` steps of work. The memory cost comes from the output array which is `O(n - k + 1)` -> `O(n - k)`.

```
class Solution 
{
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) 
    {
        int n, left, right, currentSum, max;
        
        // Grab the input length
        n = nums.length;
        
        // Initialize our window bounds
        left = 0;
        right = k - 1;
        
        // Our output
        int[] output = new int[n - k + 1];    
    
        // Iterate through each window in the input
        for (int i = 0; i < (nums.length - k + 1); i++)
        {
            
            // Check for the max within this window     
            max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;       
            for (int j = left; j <= right; j++)
            {
                max = Math.max(max, nums[j]);
            }
            
            // Set the max, move onto next window
            output[i] = max;
            left++;
            right++;
        }

        // Return the output
        return output;
    }
}
