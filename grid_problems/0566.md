## Description

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix. 

## Java Grid Iteration

So for this solution, we first check if the dimensions of the two matrices is compatible. Then we iterate through both matrices, assigning the values from the input matrix to the output. The runtime cost is `O(n * m)` which comes from iterating through the matrices, and the output array comes with a memory cost of `O(n * m)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] nums, int r, int c) {
        int n, m, k, l;
        int[][] output;
        
        n = nums.length;
        if (n == 0) return nums;
        m = nums[0].length;
        if (m == 0) return nums;
        
        if ((n * m) != (r * c)) return nums;
        
        System.out.println("I");
        
        output = new int[r][c];
        
        k = l = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                output[k][l] = nums[i][j];
                
                l += 1;
                if (l >= c) {
                    l = l % c;
                    k += 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
