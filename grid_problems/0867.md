## Description

Given a matrix A, return the transpose of A.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over it's main diagonal, switching the row and column indices of the matrix.

## Java Deep Copy

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea beind it is we create a new matrix with the "opposite" dimensions of the input, and then we copy the elements one by one transposed into the new matrix. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n * m)` which comes from iterating to each node, and the memory cost is the same because of the output matrix.

```
class Solution {
    public int[][] transpose(int[][] A) {
        int n, m;
        int[][] output;
        
        // Get the dimensions, and check for empty input
        n = A.length;
        if (n == 0) return A;
        m = A[0].length;
        if (m == 0) return A;
        
        output = new int[m][n];
        
        // Transpose the matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                output[j][i] = A[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
