## Description

Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).

## Solution Java DFS w/ memorization

This solution was from leetcode.

The idea behind this solution is this. We iterate through each spot on the board. Each time we reach a spot, we check if any of the adjacent spots are greater, and thus a path from that spot. If there are, then we check again from those adjacent spots we move to. We do this again and again, until we find the max path.

Now there is one optimization we make here, which is memorization. The idea behind it is, once we calculate the max spots we can move off of a single spot, we save it in a matrix. That way if we revisit the same spot, we won't have to redo the calculations. Due to how the recursive calls are made, the furthest spot along the path from the spot we started on will have it's result stored first, then the second furthest, then so on and so forth.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(V + E)` where `V` is the vertixes of the problem (each cell), and `E` is the number of edges (each edge is visited once). The memory cost of this algorithm which comes from the matrix `savedMoves` is `O(n*m)`
