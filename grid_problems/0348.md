## Description

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

    A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
    Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
    A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Java N^2

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We allocate a 2D board, which represents the board. Every time a move is placed, we place it on the board. Then we recurse through the board, checking what spots are set, and if there is one, check the row/column. After that we check diagnollay (we can first see if it's possible by checking the corners).


```
class TicTacToe {
    private int[][] board;
    private int len;
    //private int n;
    
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        board = new int[n][n];
        len = n;
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    private int checkSpot(int col, int row, int target) {
        int i, j;
        
        // Check for horizontal
        i = 0;
        j = row;
        while (i < len && board[i][j] == target) {
            i += 1;
        }
        
        if (i >= len) return target;
        
        j = 0;
        i = col;
        
        //Check for vertical
        while (j < len && board[i][j] == target) {
            j += 1;
        }
        
        if (j >= len) return target;
        
        // Check for diagonal
        return 0;
    }
    
    private int checkDiagonalPath(int target, int i, int j, Boolean ascending) {
        int idir = (ascending) ? -1 : 1;
        int jdir = 1;

            j += jdir;
        }
        return target;
    }
    
    private int checkDiagonal() {
        int out, end;
        out = 0;
        end = len - 1;
        if (board[0][0] == 1 && board[end][end] == 1) {
            out = checkDiagonalPath(1, 0, 0, false);

    }

## Java Arrays

This was my second solution to this problem, which has a much better runtime. Thing is, the majority of the runtime is spent checking horizontal / vertical win conditions. We can do this in a much better way. We have two int arrays, one for each column, and another for each row. We assign a value to both players, either `-1` or `2` (opposite signs so we don't have conflictions). Each time we insert onto a spot, we add it's value to the row / column total value. Then we can just check if the total value is equal to `n*player_value`, which if it is, we know the player controls the entire array. The diagonal check remains the same.

```
class TicTacToe {
    private int[][] board;
    private int[] cols;
    private int[] rows;
    private int len;
    
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        board = new int[n][n];
        
        cols = new int[n];
        rows = new int[n];
        len = n;
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */

    private int checkDiagonalPath(int target, int i, int j, Boolean ascending) {
        int idir = (ascending) ? -1 : 1;
        int jdir = 1;
        while (0 <= i && i <= len - 1 && 0 <= j && j <= len - 1) {
            if (board[i][j] != target) return 0;
            i += idir;
