## Description

Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

## Java Backtracking Depth-First Search

So this was my initial solution to this problem. The idea behind my solution is this. I iterate through the board, looking for the first character of the input string. When I find a match I start a depth first search. This search checks if the adjacent spots have a character that matches the next needed character, and if so they continue down that path.

The backtracking comes in with the fact that if we reach a dead end, we will backtrack to the last node where we still have adjacent spots left to check, and check those.

Now one requirement about this problem is we can only use a spot once. As such, we need a way to keep track of what spots we've reached. To do this, I use a HashSet.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O((n * m) * (4^l))`, where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the input board. The `(n * m)` comes from the fact that we look at every spot in the grid. The length of the input string is `l`, and the `4^l` comes from the depth first search, where we look at the adjacent spots. The memory cost is `O(l)` which comes from the hashset.

        if (usedSpots.contains((i * m) + j)) return false;
        
        // Add this spot to the list of visited spots
        usedSpots.add((i * m) + j);
        
        // See if we've reached the end
        if (x == word.length() - 1) return true;
