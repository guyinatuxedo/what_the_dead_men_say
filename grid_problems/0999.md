# 999

On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is one white rook.  There also may be empty squares, white bishops, and black pawns.  These are given as characters 'R', '.', 'B', and 'p' respectively. Uppercase characters represent white pieces, and lowercase characters represent black pieces.

The rook moves as in the rules of Chess: it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north, east, west, and south), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the edge of the board, or captures an opposite colored pawn by moving to the same square it occupies.  Also, rooks cannot move into the same square as other friendly bishops.

Return the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move.

## Java Grid Iteration

So this was a simple iterative solution. The design is slightly off from the spec, since this is designed for a board with multiple rooks. We start off, iterating through all of the spots on the board. For each rook, we add it's coordinates to a stack. Then we pop each rook's coordinates from the stack. We check each of the four ways it can move, via a function that effectively checks one direction from the rook, which is passed via arguments.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is effectively `O(n * m)`, since it looks at every spot once. The memory cost is `O(r)` where `r` is the number of rooks, because of the stack.
