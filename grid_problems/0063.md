## Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

## Java Dynamic Programming

So the idea behind this solution which was from leetcode is this. For each spot that isn't blocked, we store an integer there that is equal to the number of paths from the starting node that the robot can take there.

To start this we initialize the top row and leftmost column with `1s`. Then we can calculate the number of paths the robot can take to an adjacent spot, by adding the possible paths for the spot above it and two the left, since those are the only two spots that the robot can move to that square from. We effectively just iterate through the board doing this, until we reach the end.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(m * n)` since we have to look at each node in the board. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)` since we just edit the board in place.

{
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) 
    {
        int n, m;
        n = obstacleGrid.length;
        m = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        
        if ((n == 0) || (m == 0)) return 0;
        
        // If first spot is blocked, no possible paths
        if (obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        
        obstacleGrid[0][0] = 1;
        
        // Inialize firs row with 1s
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {

            }

        }

        // Calculate the number of paths from the starting
        // spot to each spot, via adding the paths
        // from the above spot and leftmost spot
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 1; j < m; j++)
            {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0)
                {
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i - 1][j] + obstacleGrid[i][j - 1];
                }
