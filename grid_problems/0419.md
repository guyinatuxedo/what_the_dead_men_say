## Description

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules:

    You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
    Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
    At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.


## Java Hashset

This was my first solution to this problem. This is the idea behind the solution. We use a HashSet to store coordinates we've seend. We iterate through the board, looking for battleships. When we find one, we add all spots from the battleship to our hashset, and increment the battleship count. Then as we're iterating through the spots, if we find a spot that we have in our hashset, we can just skip it.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n * m)` since we have to visit all spots on the board. The memory cost is equal to the number of spots on the board that have a battleship on them, because of the hashset.

    public HashSet<Integer> processBattleship(int i, int j, HashSet<Integer> seenCords, char[][] board) {
        int m = board[0].length;
        
        int cord = (i * m) + j;
        seenCords.add(cord);
        
        int y = i + 1;
        int x = j;
        
        // Iterate Down
        while (y < board.length && board[y][x] == 'X') {

            cord = (y * m) + x;
            seenCords.add(cord);
            y += 1;
        }
