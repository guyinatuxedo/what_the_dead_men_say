## Description

There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.

The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.

## Java Iteration w/ Switch Case

So for this solution, we just iterate through the characters of the string. We keep track of the cordinates, as the robot makes each move. After the iteration, we check if the robot is back at the origin. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost if `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int x, y, i, n;
        char c;
        
        x = y = 0;
        n = moves.length();
        
        // Iterate through the input string
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            c = moves.charAt(i);
            
            // Handle the cord change
            switch (c) {
                    case 'U':
                        y += 1;
                        continue;
                    case 'D':
                        y -= 1;
                        continue;
                    case 'L':
                        x -= 1;
                        continue;
                    case 'R':
                        x += 1;
                        continue;
            }
        }
        
        // Check if the robot is back at origin
        if ((y == 0) && (x == 0)) return true;
        
        return false;
    }
}
```
