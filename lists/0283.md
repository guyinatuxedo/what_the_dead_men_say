## Problem

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

## Solution Java Iterative

So this solution relies on a single pass through the array, with an index. The index represents the spot of the last placed non-zero value. I iterate through the array, checking if each value is `0`. If it isn't I move it to the index `j` (initialized to `0`), and increment `j` by one. If it is zero I move on. By the time i finish iterating through the array, all of the non-zero values will be moved to the left. Then from `j` on to the rest of the array, I set all of them to `0` to move the zeroes to one end of the array. The memory cost of this algorithm is `O(1)`, and the runtime cost is `O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {

        // Index to keep track of where the last non-zero number is
        int j = 0;
        
        // Move over all non-zero numbers to the left
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
        {
            if (nums[i] != 0)
            {
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        // Set the rest of the spots to zero
        for (int i = j; i < len; i++)
        {
            nums[i] = 0;
        }

    }
}
```
