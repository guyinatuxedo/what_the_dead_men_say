## Description

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

```
Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 2
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4

Example 4:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 0
Output: 0
```

## Java Iterative Search

My first solution for this was pretty simple. It essentially is just a linear sweep of the input list. I iterate through the list, checking for either a target value or a value larger than the target value. In either case, the desired index will be that index at the time the check is passed. If we iterate through the list without passing the check, then the index will be the next one after the end, which is stored in `i`.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of numbers in `nums`. The memory cost is `O(1)` since the only memory I use is a static number of variables.

```
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int i;
        
        // Iterate through input numbers
        for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            // Check if we've reached the target, or greater value
            if ((nums[i] == target) || (nums[i] > target) ) return i;
        }
        
        // target will be inserted at the end
        return i;
    }
}
```

## Java Binary Search

So this algorithm I learned from leetcode. It has a better runtime cost than the earlier solution. How this works is simple. It establishes two bounds, which start off with being the ends of the array. It then checks the middle point between those. If it is equal to the target value, we have our index. If it is less than the value at the index, we know it must be to the left of it, and vice versa. When that happens, we can set either the left or right bounds to the left or right of that middle point. That way with every time we search a spot, we eliminate half of the remaining possible values to be searched. As such this leaves us with an `O(log(n))` runtime cost, with an `O(1)` memory cost.

```
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Declare / Initialize our indexes
        int left, right, pivot;

        left = pivot = 0;
        right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left <= right)
        {
            // Calculate the middle point, which is the pivot
            pivot = left + ((right - left) / 2);

            // Check to see if we have found the index
            if (target == nums[pivot]) return pivot;
            
            // Check to see if we are on the left side
            else if (target > nums[pivot]) left = pivot + 1;
            
            // If we reach here, the value is on the right side
            else right = pivot - 1;

        }

        // If we reach here, the value is not in the list
        // The index it would be inserted into is stored in left
        // This is because the value is greater than anything in the list
        return left;
    }
}
```
