## Description

Given an integer array nums of 2n integers, group these integers into n pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) such that the sum of min(ai, bi) for all i is maximized. Return the maximized sum.

## Java Sorting

So, we are looking for the maximum sum we can get by pairing all elements in groups of two, and adding the lesser of them to the sum. So for this, sorting the input array is really helpful since we can tell the value of an element compared to other elements in the array. Now for choosing the elements which would give us the highest value. We can pair adjacent elements together, since that way we would pair the 1st highest and the 2nd highest, and the 3rd highest and the 4th highest, so on and so forth. That way we would get the 2nd highest, the 4th highest, etc. This will give us the max. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n/2) -> O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
        int output;
        
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        output = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < (nums.length); i+= 2) {
            output += nums[i];    
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
