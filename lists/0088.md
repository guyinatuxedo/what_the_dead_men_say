## Description

Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

## Java 3 Indices New Array Merge

This was my first solution to this challenge. The idea behind my solution here is this. I allocate a new array that will be a placeholder for what the final values will be. I have three indices, one for the tmp array, and two for the input arrays. I then iterate through the two input arrays, adding the smaller element to the tmp array and incrementing it's index to iterate through it.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(2*(m + n))`, since we have to iterate through both arrays once to store the values in the tmp array, then again to move the values from the tmp array back to `nums1`. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(m + n)` because of the tmp array. 



```
class Solution 
{
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) 
    {
        int i, j, k;
        
        i = j = k = 0;
        
        // Check for one of the input arrays being empty
        if ((m == 0) && (n == 0))
        {
            return;
        }
        
        else if (m == 0)
        {
            for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
            {
                nums1[i] = nums2[i];
            }

            return;
        }

        else if (n == 0)
        {
            return;
        }
        
        int[] output = new int[m + n];
    
        // Merge the two lists together in a sorted fashion
        while ((j < m) && (k < n))
        {
            if ((nums1[j] < nums2[k]) && (j < m))
            {
                output[i] = nums1[j++];
            }
            
            else
            {
                output[i] = nums2[k++];
            }
            i++;
        }
        
        // Add the remaining values
        while (j < m)
        {
            output[i] = nums1[j++];
            i++;
        }
        
        while (k < n)
        {
            output[i] = nums2[k++];
            i++;
        }        

        // Write the sorted values to the input array
        for (i = 0; i < output.length; i++)
        {
            nums1[i] = output[i];
        }
    }
}
```

## Java 3 Indices Backwards Merge

So this is an optimized version of the algorithm above from leetcode. The optimization comes from that it doesn't require a `tmp` array, and only one `O(m + n)` pass. The idea behind this solution is this. We merge via the greatest elements directly to the back of `nums1`. It is specified that `nums1` has enough space for both `nums1` and `nums2`. I was slightly skeptical at first that it might overwrite a value we needed, but then realized, if we insert an element from `nums1` into the back of `nums1`, that opens up a new spot where we would insert, so the total number of free spots in `nums1` wouldn't change, and there are enough free spots in `nums1` for `nums2` values also.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n + m)` because we iterate through both input arrays. The memory cost is reduced to `O(1)` since we edit `nums1` in place.

```
class Solution 
{
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) 
    {
        int i, j, k;
        
        // Initialize indices
        j = m - 1;
        k = n - 1;
        i = m + n - 1;
        
        // Merge Both Arrays backwards
        while ((j >= 0) && (k >= 0))
        {
            if (nums1[j] > nums2[k])
            {
                nums1[i--] = nums1[j--];
            }
            
            else
            {
                nums1[i--] = nums2[k--];                
            }
        }
        
        // Merge remaining array
        while (j >= 0)
        {
            nums1[i--] = nums1[j--];
        }
        
        while (k >= 0)
        {
            nums1[i--] = nums2[k--];
        }
    }
}
```
