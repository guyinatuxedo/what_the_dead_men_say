## Description

There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

## Java N^2

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We check if an individual spot is valid via iterating through the loop from the starting spot. To do this, I just initialize the tank to `0`. I add the gas, and subtract the cost, for the current index. I iterate until either the gas becomes negative (meaning this isn't a solution), or I make it around the loop.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n^2)` because for each spot on the array, I attempt another pass through the input array. The memory cost however is only `O(1)`

```
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int n, x;
        n = gas.length;
        
        // If the length of the input arrays is not equal
        // Something went horribly horribly wrong
        if (n != cost.length) return -1;
        
        // Iterate through each spot
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            x = checkSpot(gas, cost, i, n);
            if (x != -1) return x;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
    
    private int checkSpot(int[] gas, int[] cost, int i, int n) {
        int currentGas = 0;
        
        // Iterate through each spot
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Add in the next gas and cost
            currentGas += gas[i];
            currentGas -= cost[i];
            
            // If we went negative, not a solution
            if (currentGas < 0) return -1;
            
            // Increment index to next spot
            i = (i + 1) % n;
        }
        
        // This is the solution, return starting index
        return i;
    }
}
```

## Java One Pass

This is an improved solution from leetcode. This does the job in a single pass. The idea behind it is this. We break this down to two seperate problems. The first problem is does there exist a solution. To find this out, we can sum together all of the gas/costs together, and check that it is greater than or equal to `0`. Due to the accumaltive property, it doesn't matter the order at which we add together values, so we can check if there is a solution this way. We store this value with `totalGas`.

Now the second problem is, assuming there is a solution, what is the starting index. One thing to consider while solving this sub problem, is our gas can't go negative. As such, if we start at a particular spot and there is a solution, the spots before it won't make it any lower than it is. So we know the least value of that spot. So if we iterate through the input list starting from the first element and we end up negative, if there is a solution, then we know that there is a starting index past where we went negative which will add gas to make it through the loop. We store this value with `currentGas`.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we just make a single pass. The memory cost is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int n, currentGas, totalGas, startingI;
        n = gas.length;
        
        // If the length of the input arrays is not equal
        // Something went horribly horribly wrong
        if (n != cost.length) return -1;

        currentGas = startingI = totalGas = 0;
        
        // Iterate through each spot
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // update current/total gas counts
            currentGas += gas[i] - cost[i];
            totalGas += gas[i] - cost[i];
            
            // If the currentGas goes negative
            // we update the possible solution
            // to the next index
            if (currentGas < 0) {
                startingI = i + 1;
                currentGas = 0;
            }
        }
        
        // If totalGas is greater than or equal to 0
        // A solution does exist
        return (totalGas >= 0) ? startingI : -1;
    }   
}
```
