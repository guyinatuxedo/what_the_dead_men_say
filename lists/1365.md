## Description

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

## Java Nested Loop

So this is the simplest solution for this problem, although it is not the most effecient. Just use a nested for loop. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n^2)`, and the memory cost is `O(n)` for the output array.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] smallerNumbersThanCurrent(int[] nums) {
        int return_array[];
        int n, i, j;
        
        n = nums.length;
        
        return_array = new int[n];
        
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                    return_array[i] += 1;            
                }
            }
        }
        
        return return_array;
        
    }
}
```
