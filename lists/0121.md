## Description

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

```
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Java Iteration

So this is probably the simplest solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. For each spot, the only other spot that matters for calculating the max profit is the lowest value to the left of it. Since the max profit that can be generated by selling on that spot is by buying on the lowest day before it, and then selling it on that day.

So this solution does two things, with one pass through the input array. First it keeps track of the lowest value it has seen so far (since we go left to right, this will be that lowest value described above). Then for each spot we iterate through the array, we check to see if the max profit generated by selling the stock on that day will exceed our max possible profit.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` due to the linear pass, and the memory cost of this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int min, profit, n, i;
        
        n = prices.length;
        
        min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        profit = 0;
        
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Check if the min value left of
            // current spot needs to be updated
            if (prices[i] < min) {
                min = prices[i];
            }
            
            // Check if there is a new max profit
            if ((prices[i] - min) > profit) profit = (prices[i] - min);
        }
        
        return profit;
    }
}
```
