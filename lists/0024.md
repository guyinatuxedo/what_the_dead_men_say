## Description

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.


Example:

Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

## Java Iterative

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind this solution is I iterate through the linked list. For each iteration, there are four values I keep track of. These are `x`, `y` (the two nodes we reversed, with x being the first), `next` (next node after `x/y`), and `prev` (nodes before `x/y`). I effectively just swap `x/y`, and use the `next/prev` nodes to relink the two reversed nodes. I have a check for `y == null` in the case we have a list with an odd number of nodes.

Also there is a check if `prev` is null, then we are on the first reversal, in which case we will need to update the new head to be `y`.

        x = head;
        
        prev = null;
        
        while (x != null)
        {
            y = x.next;
            if (y == null) return head;
            next = y.next;
            if (prev == null) 
                head = y;
            else prev.next = y;
            y.next = x;
            x.next = next;
            prev = x;
            x = next;

            
        }

    }
}
