## Description

Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all elements in arr2 are also in arr1.

Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 are the same as in arr2.  Elements that don't appear in arr2 should be placed at the end of arr1 in ascending order.

## Java Hashmaps/Arraylist

So this solution has several different parts. The first part is that we initialize all fo the elements in `arr2` in a hashmap. We then iterate through `arr1`. If an element is in the hashmap, we increment the count (hashmap is used to keep track of how many times we see each element). If it isn't, we add it to an arraylist. Then we construct the output via iterating through `arr2` again, and adding the proper amount which is stored in the hashmap to the output. We then sort the leftover arraylist, and add it to the end.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] relativeSortArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> relNums;
        ArrayList<Integer> notRel;
        int[] output;
        int x, j;
        
        relNums = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        notRel = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        output = new int[arr1.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {
            relNums.put(arr2[i], 0);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            if (relNums.containsKey(arr1[i])) {
                x = relNums.get(arr1[i]);
                x += 1;
                relNums.put(arr1[i], x);
            }
            
            else {
                notRel.add(arr1[i]);
            }
        }
        
        j = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++) {
            x = relNums.get(arr2[i]);
            for (int k = 0; k < x; k++) {
                output[j] = arr2[i];
                j += 1;
            }
        }
        
        Collections.sort(notRel);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < notRel.size(); i++) {
            output[j] = notRel.get(i);
            j += 1;
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
