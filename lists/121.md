## Description

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

```
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Java Iteration

So my original solution really overcomplicated things. It involved scanning through the array to find the max and min values, and doing a lot of computations based on that, and some recursive calls for edge cases. Turns out I was just having a major smooth brain moment, and there was a much better way to do it.

So our input array represents the price of the stock, as the days go on. For the stocks price on day `3`, the only stock prices that will affect the potential profit are `0-2`. So as we iterate through the array, as we are calculating the profit, we only need to consider the smallest value we've encountered so far.

The premise of this algorithm is we iterate through all of it. We keep track of the lowest value we've seen so far (for the reason I just described). Then we calculate the profit via subtracting the day's price from the lowest we've seen so far, and see if the maximum profit needs to be updated.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` (since we iterate through the entire input array). The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`, since we just use a static amount of variables.

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int min, profit;
        
        // Initialize min to a large value, max to a small one
        // That way it pretty much guarantees these will get updated (at least min will)
        min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        profit = 0;
        
        // Iterate through input array
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++)
        {
            // Check if min needs to updated
            if (prices[i] < min) min = prices[i];
            
            // Check if profit needs to be updated
            if ((prices[i] - min) > profit) profit = (prices[i] - min);
        }
        
        return profit;

    }
}
```
