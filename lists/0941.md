## Description

Given an array of integers arr, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.

Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:

```
    arr.length >= 3
    There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
        arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
        arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
```

## Java Linear Pass

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We make a linear pass through the input array (skipping the last element because we check it two at a time). For each pair, we check if it is either proper ascension, descension, or a peak. We also have a check to make sure that those three happen in the order ascension, peak, or descension. We also check to ensure that everything happens via the previous checks, and making sure that descension happens.

The runtime cost for this algorithm which comes from the linear pass is `O(n)`. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean validMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        int n;
        boolean descending, ascended;
        
        n = arr.length;
        if (n <= 1) return false;
        
        descending = ascended = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            // Check for proper ascension
            if ((arr[i] < arr[i + 1]) && (!descending)) {
                ascended = true;
                continue;
            }

            // Check for peak
            if ((arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) && (!descending) && (ascended)) {
                descending = true;
                continue;
            }
            
            // Check for proper descension
            if ((arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) && (descending)) {
                continue;
            }

            
            return false;
        }
        
        // If started descent, it is valid
        return descending;
    }
}
