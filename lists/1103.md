## Description

We distribute some number of candies, to a row of n = num_people people in the following way:

We then give 1 candy to the first person, 2 candies to the second person, and so on until we give n candies to the last person.

## Java Iterative

So for this solution, we just iterate until we run out of candy. We add the desired amount of candy to each person, while also checking if the current addition is greater than our remainning candy. The runtime cost directly scales with the number of candy given. 

```
class Solution {
    public int[] distributeCandies(int candies, int num_people) {
        int give, i;
        int[] output;
        
        output = new int[num_people];
        give = 1;
        i = 0;
        
        while (candies > 0) {
            // Check if the current handout is greater than remainning candy
            if (give > candies) give = candies;
            output[i] += give;
            candies -= give;
            
            // Move to next person
            i = (i + 1) % num_people;
            give += 1;
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
