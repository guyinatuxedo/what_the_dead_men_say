## Description

Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

## Java Iterative

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We iterate through each spot in the array. For each spot, we check if it is the start of a contiguous sequnce that leads to the desired sum. If it is, I return the sum, and check if it is the shortest.

In terms of runtime, it has an `O(n^2)` runtime, and a `O(1)` memory cost.

```
class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int s, int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int shortest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int current = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            current = check_sub_array(nums, i, s);
            shortest = Math.min(current, shortest);
        }
        if (shortest == Integer.MAX_VALUE) return 0;
        
        return shortest;
    }
    
    private int check_sub_array(int[] nums, int i, int target) {
        int size = 0;
        while (i < nums.length && target > 0) {
            target -= nums[i];
            size += 1;
            i += 1;
        }
        
        if (target <= 0) return size;
        return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    }
       
}
```

## Java Two Pointers

This was my second solution for this problem, which the idea I got was from previous leetcode problems. The idea behind it is this. I have two pointers, one that points to the beginning and the other which points to the end of my contiguous array. If my current sum is less then I need to be, I move the front of the array forward, raising it's value. If the current sum is where I need it to be, I first check if this is the smallest size so far. If it isn't I then move the back of the array forward, thus shrinking the sum.

The runtime here comes out to be `O(n)`, with a memory cost of `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int s, int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return s == nums[0] ? nums[0] : 0;
        
        int shortest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int current = 0;
        int i, j;
        int sum = nums[0];
        i = j = 0;
        int current_size;
        
        while (j < n) {
            if (sum >= s) {
                current_size = j - i + 1;
                shortest = Math.min(shortest, current_size);
                sum -= nums[i];
                i += 1;
            }
            
            else {
                j += 1;
                if (j < n) sum += nums[j];
            }
            
        }

        return (shortest != Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? shortest : 0;
    }
    

       
}
```
