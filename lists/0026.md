## Description

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Java Three Indices w Prev Value 

So this was my first solution to this challenge. The idea behind my solution is this. I iterate through the array, keeping a value that represents the last value I saw in the array. I use this `prev` value to check if the value we are currently at is a repeat. If so I grab the next value that isn't a repeat, and write it to the current spot.

To do this, I need to keep three different indices. The first is the index of the value that we are reading. The second is a tmp reading index, that is used as we are iterating through the array to find the next value that isn't a duplicate. After we find the next value, we assign the tmp index to the reading index so we skip all of the duplicates. The last is the index which we write values to, since this can lag behind the reading index since that skips past duplicates.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we iterate through the input array. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)` since we just edit the input array in place and keep a static amount of variables with static memory.

class Solution 
{
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) 
    {
        int prev, j, k;       

        // Check for empty input
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        
        // Setup first prev value
        prev = nums[0];
        k = 1;        

        // Iterate through input array
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            // Check if this is duplicate
            if (nums[i] == prev)
            {
                // Grab index of next value over
                j = i + 1;
                while ((j < nums.length) && (nums[j] == prev)) j++;
                
                // Check to ensure we didn't reach end of array
                if (j < nums.length)
                {
                    nums[k++] = nums[j];
                    i = j;
                    prev = nums[j];
                }
            }
            
            // Is not a duplicate
            // write value to input array
            else
            {
                prev = nums[i];
                nums[k++] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        return k;
    }
}
