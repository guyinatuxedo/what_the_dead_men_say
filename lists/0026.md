## Description

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Java Two Indices

So this was my first solution to this challenge. The idea behind it is this. We iterate through the array, storing two different indices. The first index `i` is the spot we are looking at. The second index `j` is the one we are writing to. If we see that we have a non-duplicated value, then we will that value to the spot at index `j`, and move `j` over to the next spot. If we see that we have a duplicated value, we just move `i`  to the next spot. Effectively `i` is the index to the input array, and `j` is the index to the non-duplicated array. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`. 

```
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int i, j, k, n;
        
        n = nums.length;
        j = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the array
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Check for duplicate or end
            if ((i < n - 1) && (nums[i] == nums[i + 1])) {
                continue;
            }
            
            // Not a duplicate
            else {
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j += 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Return length of new array
        return j;
    }
}
```
