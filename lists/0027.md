## Description

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

## Java Two Pass

My original solution for this involved two passes through the input array. The purpose of the first pass was to count the number of invalid values in the input array. With that, we can calculate the length of the output array. The second pass's purpose is to move the valid values to the front (which for our purposes "removes" them). The idea behind this is I iterate through the first `outLen` items of the array. When I reach an invalid value, I grab the next valid value from the back of the array, and set it equal to the current item.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(2n)` -> `O(n)`, since we make two passes. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int n, j, i, outLen;
        
        j = 0;
        n = nums.length;
        
        // Iterate through the input array once
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (nums[i] == val)
            {
                // Count the number of invalid values
                j = j + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate the length of the output array
        outLen = n - j;
        
        i = 0;
        j = n - 1;
        
        // Iterate through once again, to remove invalid values
        while (i != outLen)
        {
            // See if the current value needs to be removed
            if (nums[i] == val)
            {
                // Find the next valid value, set the current index to it
                while (nums[j] == val)
                {
                    j = j - 1;
                }
                
                nums[i] = nums[j];
                j = j - 1;
            }
            
            i = i + 1;
        }
        
        return outLen;
    }
}
```

## Java One Pass

This algorithm is an optimized version of the above one, that gets the job done in a single pass. It accomplishes this by in the first pass, if it reaches a valid value, it moves it to the next spot in the front of the array.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` because of the single pass, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int answer = nums.length;
        
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j += 1;
            }
            
            else {
                answer--;                
            }
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```
