## Description

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

## Java Single Pass

So my solution here involves a single pass through the input array. The idea behind it is each character, I check if the subsequent characters are repeated, and if so I count the number. If there are repeated characters, then I write the number to the array (I  have cases for the digit being one, and two characters). I also have two separate indices I keep, one for where I'm writing, and one for where I'm reading, since we have to modify the input array.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we just make a single pass, and the memory cost is `O(1)` since we just modify the input array.

class Solution 
{
    public int compress(char[] chars) 
    {
        char x;
        int y, j;
        j = 0;
        
        // Iterate through input array
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++)
        {
            x = chars[i];
            y = 1;
            
            // Count repeated characters
            while (((i + y) < (chars.length)) && (x == chars[i + y])) y++;
            
            // If we have repeated characters
            if (y > 1)
            {
                chars[j] = x;
                if (y <= 9)
                {
                    // Digit written is one character
                    chars[j + 1] = (char)((y) + 0x30);
                    i += (y - 1);
                    j +=2;
                }
                else
                {
                    // Digit written is two characters
                    chars[j + 1] = (char)((y / 10) + 0x30);
                    chars[j + 2] = (char)((y % 10) + 0x30);
                    i += (y - 1);
                    j += 3;
                }
            }
            
            else
            {
                // No repeated characters
                chars[j] = x;
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return j;
