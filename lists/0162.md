## Description

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array nums, where nums[i] â‰  nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case returning the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

## Java Iterative

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We iterate through the inout array. For each number that is not either the first or the last, we check if it is a peak by checking if it is greater than both the number before and after it. For all numbers we check if it is the biggest number so far. The reason for that, is if there only peak is on one of the ends, then it won't be caught by the previous check. Keeping track of the largest value in that instance will give us the peak (it will be a mountain that is a diagonal line).

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        if (n < 1) return -1;
        
        int max, maxIndex;
        
        max = nums[0];
        maxIndex = 0;
        
        // Iterate through array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            
            // Check if it is our max value so far
            if (nums[i] > max) {
                max = nums[i];
                maxIndex = i;
            }
            
            // Check if peak, if not a value on the end
            if (i != 0 && i != n - 1) {
                if (nums[i - 1] < nums[i] && nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) return i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxIndex;
    }
}
```
