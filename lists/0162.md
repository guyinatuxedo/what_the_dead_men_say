## Description 

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array nums, where nums[i] â‰  nums[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.

## Java Iterative

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We iterate through the array, checking each spot with it's neighbors to see if it is a peak. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` with a memory cost of `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        
        // Check if the edges are peaks
        if (nums[0] > nums[1]) return 0;
        if (nums[n - 1] > nums[n - 2]) return n - 1;
        
        // Check the rest of the array
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {        
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1] && nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) return i;
        }
        
        return 0;
    }
}
```
