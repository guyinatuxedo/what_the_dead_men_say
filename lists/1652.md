## Description

You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.

    If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
    If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
    If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.

## Java Iteration

So this is a simple solution. The idea behind it is we just iterate through each spot. For each spot, we just count the `k` number of integers in that direction to figure out the output. The runtime cost is `O(n * k)`, since for all `n` elements, there are `k` pieces of work involved. The memory cost because of the output array is `O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] decrypt(int[] code, int k) {
        int n, i, j, tmp, x;
        int[] output;
        
        n = code.length;
        
        output = new int[n];
        
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            x = 0;
            if (k > 0) {
                for (j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                    tmp = (i + j) % n;
                    x += code[tmp];    
                }
            }
            
            else if (k < 0) {
                for (j = -1; j >= k; j--) {
                    tmp = (i + j);
                    if (tmp < 0) tmp += n;
                    x += code[tmp];    
                }
            }
            
            output[i] = x;
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
