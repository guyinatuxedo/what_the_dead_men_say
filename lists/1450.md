## Description

Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.

The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].

Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.

## Java Iteratrion

So this solution is just to iterate through the students, checking if each student is working at that time. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int busyStudent(int[] startTime, int[] endTime, int queryTime) {
        int n, students;
        
        if (startTime.length != endTime.length) return 0;
        
        n = startTime.length;
        
        students = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((startTime[i] <= queryTime) && (queryTime <= endTime[i])) {
                students += 1;
            }
        }
        
        return students;
    }
}
```
