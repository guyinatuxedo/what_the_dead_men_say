## Description

Say you have an array price for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

## Java Single Pass

The idea behind this solution is this. We can buy a stock and sell it as many times as we want. In addition to that we know what the prices on each day are going to be. So we can just buy and sell stocks only when there is a gain between days. This solution buys a stock and sells it the next day, every time the stock increases in value. That way any time we can make profit, we can get that profit by doing that. So this solution just checks if there is an increase in value between two subsequent days, and if there is, it adds the profit to the total max profit.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we just iterate through the input array once. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution 
{
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) 
    {
        int max = 0;
        
        // Iterate through all of the days
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++)
        {
            // Check if there is an increase in prrices
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1])
            {
                // Add the profit to our max profit
                max += (prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
