## Description

Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.

Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.

Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.

## Java Sorting

So for this solution, we make a copy of the input and sort it. The sorted array will be in the desired order. Then we iterate through both arrays, checking which elements are different. For each element is different, that is one move that will need to be made in order to correct it. The runtime cost which primarily comes from sorting is `O(n * log(n))`, and the memory cost which comes from the copied array is `O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int[] copy = heights.clone();
        int diff = 0;
        
        Arrays.sort(copy);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            if (heights[i] != copy[i]) diff++;
        }
        
        return diff;
    }
}
```
