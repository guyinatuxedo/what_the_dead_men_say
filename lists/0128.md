## Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

## Java Hashset Iteration

The idea behind this solution is this. We store all of the numbers in a hashset. Then we check the continuous sequences starting from the lowest number in the sequnce (to prevent checking the same sequence multiple times, and not from an end which would yield the highest length). We do this via iterating through all numbers in the hashset and checking if the hashset contains the next lower number than it, and if it doesn't see how long the ascending sequence is.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is a linear `O(n)`, along with the memory cost which comes from the hashset.

```
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> nums_seen = new HashSet<Integer>();
        
        // Add all numbers to the hashset
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            nums_seen.add(nums[i]);
        }
        
        int longest = 0;
        
        // Iterate through all numbers in the hashet
        for (int num : nums_seen) {
            // If this isn't the lowest numberin the continuous sequence
            // skip it
            if (!nums_seen.contains(num - 1)) {
                int streak = 1;
                int i = num + 1;
                
                // Count this streak, from the lowest to highest
                while (nums_seen.contains(i)) {
                    i++;
                    streak++;
                }
                
                // See if it is the longest sequence so far
                longest = Math.max(streak, longest);
            }
        }
        
        return longest;
    }
}
