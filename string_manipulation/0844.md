## Description

Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

## Java StringBuilder

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is I create new strings that don't have the deleted chars. To do this I iterate through both of the strings, and whenever I get to a `#` I remove the last character.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(m + n)` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the input strings. This is because I iterate through both strings. The memory cost is `O(m + n)`  because of the output strings as well, however the deleted chars also have an effect.

```
class Solution 
{    
    // Helper function to construct new string with backspace deletes
    private String deleteChars(String S)
    {
        int x, n;
        StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Our count of letters in the output
        x = 0;
        
        n = S.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            // We're deleting a character
            if (S.charAt(i) == '#')
            {
                if (x <= 0) continue;
                string.deleteCharAt(x - 1);
                x--;
            }
            
            // We're adding a character
            else
            {
                string.append(S.charAt(i));
                x++;
            }
        }
        
        return string.toString();
    }
    public boolean backspaceCompare(String S, String T) 
    {       
        // Check the two strings via generating 
        // new stringwith the characters deleted
        return deleteChars(S).equals(deleteChars(T));
    }
}
```

## Java Two Indices

So this was my second solution to this problem, which is optimized. The idea behind it is we iterate through both strings with two separate indices, checking the characters as we go. When we reach a `#` in one of the strings, we move the index forward to simulate deleting the character. Also we iterate backwards, that way as we're dealing with multiple `#`, we hit those before the deleted characters, so it makes it easier.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(l)` where `l` is the larger string between the two, since we iterate through both strings at the same time. The memory cost for the algorithm is upgraded to `O(1)`. 

```
class Solution 
{    
    // This is a helper function to delete chars
    private int deleteChars(String S, int i)
    {
        int x;
        while ((i >= 0) && (S.charAt(i) == '#'))
        {
            x = 1;
            i--;
                
            while ((i >= 0) && (x > 0))
            {
                if (S.charAt(i) == '#') x += 2;
                i--;
                x--;
            }                                          
        }        
        
        return i;
    }
    
    public boolean backspaceCompare(String S, String T) 
    {       
        int n, m, i, j, x, y;
        
        n = S.length();
        m = T.length();
        
        // Initialize ptrs to back of string
        // we iterate backwards
        i = n - 1;
        j = m - 1;
        
        // Iterate through both strings,
        // while both strings have chars left
        while ((i >= 0) && (j >= 0))
        {   
            // Delete the chars
            i = deleteChars(S, i);
            j = deleteChars(T, j);         
            
            // Check if they're equal
            if ((i >= 0) && (j >= 0))
            {

                if (S.charAt(i) != T.charAt(j)) return false;
                i--;
                j--;
            }            
        }
        
        // Remove final backspaces, and check if they're both empty
        i = deleteChars(S, i);
        j = deleteChars(T, j);   
        if ((i >= 0) || (j >= 0)) return false;
        
        return true;
    }
}
