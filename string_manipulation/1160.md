## Description

You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

## Java Hashmaps

So this solution revolves around using hashmaps. We first make a hashmap that contains all of the available characters, where the key is the character and the value is the number of instances we have of that character. Then we iterate through each word. For each word we make a deep copy of the previous hashmap. We iterate through each character, and check if the hashmap has a non-zero value for it. If it does, we decrement it (since that character has been used). If it has a zero value, then we know we can't make that word. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(c + w*l)` where `c` is the number of available characters, `w` is the number of words, and `l` is the average length of the input words.

class Solution {
    public int countCharacters(String[] words, String chars) {
        int count, wordCount;
        Character c;
        HashMap<Character, Integer> availableChars, cpyMap;
        boolean valid;
        
        // Quantify available chars
        availableChars = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length(); i++) {
            count = availableChars.getOrDefault(chars.charAt(i), 0);
            count += 1;
            availableChars.put(chars.charAt(i), count);
        }
        
        wordCount = 0;
        
        // Iterate through each word
        for (String word: words) {
            cpyMap = new HashMap<Character, Integer>(availableChars);
            valid = true;
            
            // Check if this word can be made
            for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
                c = word.charAt(i);
                count = cpyMap.getOrDefault(c, 0);
                if (count == 0) {
                    valid = false;
                    break;
                }
                
                count -= 1;
                cpyMap.put(c, count);
            }
            
            if (valid) wordCount += word.length();
        }
        
        return wordCount;
    }
}
