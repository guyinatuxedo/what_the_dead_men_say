## Description

Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

## Java Depth First Search w/ memorization

So starting off, I tried two different solutions. The first involved parsing out blocks of the input string that certain words from the dictionary would fit into. The second was marking indices that words would cover over. These two things didn't take into account that while certain words may cover certain portions, to the point where every letter is covered, there could still be combinations that work or didn't work.

This solution was from leetcode. The idea behind it is we make recursive calls. We try to slice of incrementing parts of the input string, and if there is a word that fits, then we make a recursive clal to the rest of the string. If that fails then we backtrack back and try again.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {

        return check(s, new HashSet(wordDict), 0, new Boolean[s.length()]);
    }
    
    private boolean check(String s, HashSet<String> dict, int start, Boolean[] savedResults) {
        // We've reached the end if this is true
        if (start == s.length()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Check if we've already solved this problem
        if (savedResults[start] != null) {
            return savedResults[start];
        }
        
        // Iterate down
        for (int end = start + 1; end <= s.length(); end++) {
            if (dict.contains(s.substring(start, end)) && check(s, dict, end, savedResults)) {
                savedResults[start] = true;
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        savedResults[start] = false;
        return false;
    }
}
```
