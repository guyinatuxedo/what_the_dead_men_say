## Java Iteration

So this solution is pretty simple. The idea behind it is that when we are finding a range, we store the first value in `base`. Then we check for the range by continuing to iterate through the input, until we get to a value that is greater than `1 + previous_value`, we know we have reached the end of a range. To append to the end of the range, I check if it is a single digit range by seeing if the greatest value in the range is equal to the least value in the range. After the iteration is done, I will need to add the final range.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost for this algorithm is `O(r)` where `r` is the number of ranges (in the worst case, it becomes `O(n)`). 

```
class Solution {
    // Helper function to add ranges
    public void addRange(List<String> ranges, int base, int max)
    {
            // Check if this is a single digit range
            if (max == base)
            {
                ranges.add(Integer.toString(base));
            }
        
            // Multi digit range
            else
            {
                ranges.add(base + "->" + max);      
            }
    }
    public List<String> summaryRanges(int[] nums) {
        int base, working;
        
        // Our list which will store our ranges
        List<String> ranges = new ArrayList();        
        
        // Check for empty input
        if (nums.length == 0) return ranges;
        
        // Initialize our values for iteration
        working = base = nums[0];
        
        // Iterate through the input array
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            // Check if the next number isn't in the same range
            if ((nums[i]) != (working + 1))
            {
                // Add the range, move onto the next one
                addRange(ranges, base, working);
                base = nums[i];
            }          
            
            working = nums[i];
        }
        
        // Add the final range
        addRange(ranges, base, working);        
        
        return ranges;
    }
}
```
