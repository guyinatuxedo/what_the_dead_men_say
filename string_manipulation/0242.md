## Description

Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

## Java Sorting

So my solution here, revolves around sorting the input array, and then checking if they are equal. Since anagrams have all the same characters just a different order, sorting them will get rid of the one difference which is the ordering. The runtime cost of this algorithm which primarily comes from sorting is `O(n * log(n))`,a dn the memory cost which comes from the arrays we sort is `O(n)`:

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isAnagram(String s, String t) {
        char[] sSorted, tSorted;
        int n;
        
        if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;
        
        n = s.length();
        
        sSorted = s.toCharArray();
        tSorted = t.toCharArray();
        
        Arrays.sort(sSorted);
        Arrays.sort(tSorted);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (sSorted[i] != tSorted[i]) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
