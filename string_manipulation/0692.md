## Description

Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.

## Java HashMap and MinHeap PriorityQueue

So the idea behind this solution is this. First we iterate through each word, and update the count we have for it which is stored in a hashMap. 

This next part I needed some help from leetcode with. We will sort the words by their word count. This is done through the use of a PriorityQueue with our own custom comparator. The comparator checks if their word counts are equal. If they aren't equal, it sorts by the word count. If they are then it sorts by the string itself.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n + n*log(k))`. The `n` comes from populating the wordCount hashMap, and the `n*log(k)` comes from sorting via the PriorityQueue. The memory cost is `O(x + k)` where `x` is the number of words which comes from the hashMap, and `k` comes from the PriorityQueue.

```
class Solution 
{

    public List<String> topKFrequent(String[] words, int k) 
    {
        // Our hashMap to store the word counts
        HashMap<String, Integer> wordCount = new HashMap<String, Integer>();

        // Get the count for each word
        int x = 0;
        for (String word: words)
        {
            x = wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0);
            wordCount.put(word, x + 1);
        }
        
        // Our priority queue with out custom comparator
        PriorityQueue<String> heap = new PriorityQueue<String>
            (   // Our lamda function
                (str0, str1) ->
                (wordCount.get(str0).equals(wordCount.get(str1))) ? 

                // Word counts are same, sort by string
                str1.compareTo(str0) : 
            
                // Sort by word count
                wordCount.get(str0) - wordCount.get(str1)
            );

        // Leverage our minHeap to get the kth most found words
        for (String word: wordCount.keySet()) 
        {
            heap.offer(word);
            if (heap.size() > k) heap.poll();
        }     
        
        // Append the words to our output array, reverse it, and return it
        List<String> ans = new ArrayList();
        while (!heap.isEmpty()) 
        {   
            ans.add(heap.poll());
        }
        
        Collections.reverse(ans);
        return ans;
    }
}
```
