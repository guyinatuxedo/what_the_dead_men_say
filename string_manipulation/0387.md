## Description

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

## Java Linear Pass Hashmap

This was the first solution I came up with for this problem. The idea behind this solution is this. I have a hashMap that stores the count for each character (key is character, value is an integer). I iterate through the input twice. The first time I count the count of each character and store it in the hashMap. The second pass is to find the first character with a count of `1` and return it's index.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(2n)` -> `O(n)` due to the two linear passes. The memory cost of this algorithm is `O(c)` where `c` is the number of unique characters in the input string. The value of `c` will range between `0-26`.


```
class Solution 
{
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) 
    {
        int x, n;
        char c;
        
        HashMap<Character, Integer> numCount = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        n = s.length();
        
        // Populate the numCount HashMap
        // With the count of characters
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            c = s.charAt(i);
            x = numCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1;
            numCount.put(c, x);
        }
        
        // Check the first character to appear once
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            x = numCount.getOrDefault(s.charAt(i), 0);
            if (x == 1) return i;
        }
        
        // No character appears once
        return -1;
    }
}
```
