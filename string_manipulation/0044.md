## Description

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.

```
'?' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
```
## Java Backtracking

So one of the biggest problems with this, is with the `*` character. Particularly with the string after `*` can mean the first/second/third/etc pattern of the string after that. In order to solve this problem, we use backtracking.

So for this solution, we have two indices, one for this input string and the other for the pattern. We iterate through untill the index for the input string reaches oob. The first case is when both indices point to characters not `?/*`, in which case we just compare the two. The second case is when the pattern matching character is `?`. In both of these cases, we just increment both indices by `1` to move onto the next character. If they are two characters that are not matched, they will be caught by a future check.

The next case is when the pattern character is a `*`. In this instance, we save the index the star is at, as well as the string character. The next check is if we see that the saved star index isn't set, we know the two characters do not match and therefore the pattern doesn't match. The final case is when there is a star character, but the pattern does not match. In this instance we effectively move forward the string pattern index untill it matches the character right after the `*`. Now when this happens, the string pattern index is saved. That way if later on the pattern doesn't match, we can backtrack to this index, move the string index forward to another instance of that pattern, then try again.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {
        int slen, plen;
        slen = s.length();
        plen = p.length();
        
        int i, j, starIdx, jTmp;
        
        i = j = 0;
        starIdx = jTmp = -1;
        
        while (j < slen) {
            // If we reach a '?' char
            // Or both chars are equal
            // Move on to next character
            if (i < plen && (p.charAt(i) == '?' || p.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j))) {
                ++i;
                ++j;
            }
            
            // If we reached a '*' character, set the indices for that
            else if (i < plen && p.charAt(i) == '*') {
                starIdx = i;
                jTmp = j;
                i++;
            }
            
            // Characters do not, and there
            // were no '?' or '*' characters
            // pattern does not match
            else if (starIdx == -1) {
                return false;
            }
            
            // backtrack to work around '*'
            // move forward string pointer by 1
            // based on the last index with '*'
            else {
                i = starIdx + 1;
                j = jTmp + 1;
                jTmp = j;
            }
        }
        
        // Check if remainder chars are '*'
        for (int k = i; k < plen; k++) {
            if (p.charAt(k) != '*') return false;
        }
        
        return true;
        
    }
}
