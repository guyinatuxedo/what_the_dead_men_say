## Description

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

```
Example 1:

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: "race a car"
Output: false
```

## Java Two Indices

So for this solution, the idea behind it is we iterate through half of the string (or maybe a few spots more). We keep two indices, which indicate what characters on both sides we are checking. After we iterate two new chars, we check to see if they are alphanumeric, and if they aren't we iterate until we get one on that side (checking of course for index oob). Then we check to see if the characters are equal (convert both to lowercase so case insensitive) and move on to the next check.

For checking to see if we have finished checking, I see if the index on the left end is greater than or equal to the index on the right end. Since the left index only increases and the right index only decreases, this is bound to happen at some point. I check this both at the start of the loop, and after we parse through the non-alphanumeric characters, since those are the times at which the indices increase/decrease.

In terms of runtime, this algorithm is `O(n)`, although including constants it's more like `O(n/2)`. In terms of memory cost, it is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int i, j, n;
        char c0, c1;
        
        // Get / check length of input
        n = s.length();
        if (n <= 1) return true;
        
        // Initialize the ptrs
        i = 0;
        j = n - 1;
        
        // Iterate through the string
        while (i < j) {
            // Get the next characters
            c0 = s.charAt(i);
            while (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(c0) && i < j) {
                i += 1;
                c0 = s.charAt(i);
            }
            
            c1 = s.charAt(j);
            while (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(c1) && j > i) {
                j -= 1;
                c1 = s.charAt(j);
            }
            
            // Check if we've reached the middle
            if (j <= i) return true;
            
            // Convert to lower case, to get rid of case sensitivity
            c0 = Character.toLowerCase(c0);
            c1 = Character.toLowerCase(c1);
            
            // Check if the characters are equal
            if (c0 != c1) return false;
            
            // Movie indices over to next characters
            i += 1;
            j -= 1;
        }
        
        // Iterated through the string, it is a palindrome
        return true;
    }
}
```
