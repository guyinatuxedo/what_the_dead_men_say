## Description

Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array where source[i] is the i-th line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n.

## Java String Iteration

So this is the idea behind this solution. We iterate through each string in the input array. As we iterate through the string, we are checking for three specific groups of two characters. These characters are `//` for line comments, `/*` for beginning of block quotes. This solution was from leetcode.

Now each element of the input array is an individual line. So when we reach a `//`, we can just stop iterating through the rest of that line, and add what we have so far to the output.

Now for the `/*`, once we reach it, everything else after it until we reach a `*/` is a comment. As such, we can ignore `//`. In addition to that since `*/` is to only close out, if we reach one without an opening `/*` we can just ignore commenting out the section.

Also another thing we have to look out for, is block comments that extend multiple lines. For this, we treat the beginning uncommented portion of the line which the block begins and the end uncommented portion of the line which ends the block comment as a single line.

Now if a character isn't in a comments section (either line or block) we can add it to the output. We do this via a stringbuilder.

The runtime and memory cost of this algorithm is both `O(n)` where `n` is the number of character is the source code. The reason for the runtime cost is we have to look at each character of the source code. The reason for the memory cost is because we have to store the source code uncommented code in memory for this algorithm, although the higher the percentage of the source code is commented will lead to less overall memory usage since we don't store comments in memory.

class Solution 
{
    public List<String> removeComments(String[] source) 
    {
        // Our output list
        List<String> output = new ArrayList<String>();

        StringBuilder newline = new StringBuilder();

        boolean commentedOut = false;
        
        // Iterate through each string
        for (String line: source)
        {
            int i = 0;
            char[] chars = line.toCharArray();
            
            // If not in a block comment, make a new line
            if (!commentedOut) newline = new StringBuilder();
            
            // Iterate through this line
            while (i < line.length())
            {
                // Check if it is beginning of block comment
                if (!commentedOut && i+1 < line.length() && chars[i] == '/' && chars[i + 1] == '*')
                {
                    commentedOut = true;
                    i++;
                }
                  
                // Check if it is end of block comment
                else if (commentedOut && i+1 < line.length() && chars[i] == '*' && chars[i + 1] == '/')
                {
                    commentedOut = false;
                    i++;
                }
                    
                // Check if it is a line comment
                else if (!commentedOut && i+1 < line.length() && chars[i] == '/' && chars[i + 1] == '/')
                {
                    break;
                }
                    
                // Character is not part of a commented section
                else if (!commentedOut)
                {
                    newline.append(chars[i]);
                }
                
                i++;
            }
                
            // If not in a block comment, add line to output
            if (!commentedOut && newline.length() > 0)
            {
                output.add(new String(newline));
            }
            
        }
            
        return output;
