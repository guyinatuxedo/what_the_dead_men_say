## Description


Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

```
    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:

Input: "()"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:

Input: "([)]"
Output: false

Example 5:

Input: "{[]}"
Output: true
```

## Java Stack Solution

My solution here revolves around using a stack. With this solution, we iterate through each character of the input string. While doing this, there are two events that occur at which we can determine invalid parentheses. The first is when we reach an "ending" parentheses (which are `(` or `{` or `[`). When we reach one of these, if the last parentheses was not the corresponding "beginning" parentheses, we know that the parentheses are not valid. 

We can leverage a stack to solve this problem. Whenever we reach a beginning parentheses (either `(` or `{` or `[`) we add the character to the stack. Then when we reach an ending parentheses, we can just pop the last value off of the stack to get it's corresponding parentheses, and check it right then and there. Before we pop it though we check if the stack is empty, and if it is we don't have valid parentheses.

The second event when we can check for an invalid parentheses is after we finish iterating through the input string. If the stack is not empty after that, then we know there is a beginning parentheses without a closing one, so they are not valid.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, since we iterate through each of the input characters (`n` being the number of characters in the input string). All of the stack operations are `O(1)` which helps with the runtime cost. The memory cost associated with this algorithm is `O(b)` where `b` is the number of input parentheses. In the worst case scenario, this turns into an `O(n)` memory cost, which happens if every character is a beginning parentheses (since in that case, we wouldn't deem it an invalid parentheses until after we iterate through the input string.)

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        // Check for null string
        if (s == null) return true;
        
        // Our Characters
        char c, x;
        
        // Make our stack
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();
        
        // Iterate through each of the characters in the string
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
        {
            // Grab the current character
            c = s.charAt(i);

            // If the character is a 'beginning' parentheses, add to stack
            if ((c == '(') || (c == '{') || (c == '['))
            {
                stack.add(c);
            }
            
            // This is if we reached an 'ending' parentheses
            if ((c == ')') || (c == '}') || (c == ']'))
            {
                // If stack is empty, parentheses not valid
                if (stack.empty() == true) return false;
                
                // Grab the corresponding parentheses
                x = stack.pop();
                
                // Check if the two parentheses match
                if (((x == '(' && c == ')') || (x == '{' && c == '}') || (x == '[' && c == ']')) == false)
                {
                    // parentheses do not match
                    return false;
                }
            }
        


    }
        // If the stack is empty, parentheses are valid
        if (stack.empty() == true) return true;
        return false;
    }
}
```
