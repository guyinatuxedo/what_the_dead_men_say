## Description

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

## Java Sliding Window HashMap

The idea behind this solution is this. We have a sliding window that is comprised of a hashmap, and two indices that represent the left and right bounds. We iterate through each character of the string. As we reach a new character, we add it to the hashmap, where the value is the index. Now what this does, is it stores all of the unique characters as the key, with the value being the rightmost index we've seen that character at. This does several things for us.

First off, the size of the hashmap will be equal to the number of unique characters that are currently in our window, so checking if we've surpassed out unique character limit is pretty easy. If it has, then we can just get the least highest value from the hashmap, which corresponds to the leftmost unique character/s, which is the character we can remove from our window that shortens the string as much as possible. We can just remove that character, and move up the left bound, and we will be within our limit again. Then after that, we can get the size of the current window using the left and right end indices, and update the max length if need be.

```
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstringKDistinct(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();

        // Check for empty string, and 0 k
        if (n * k == 0) return 0;
        
        // Our window bounds
        int left, right;
        left = right = 0;
        
        // Max lenght is at least one, since passed prior checks
        int max_len = 1;
        
        // Our hash map
        HashMap<Character, Integer> window = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        
        // Iterate through the string
        while (right < n) {
            
            // Store the furthest index we've seen this character
            window.put(s.charAt(right), right++);
            
            if (window.size() > k) {
                // Get the index of the furthest left character, and remove it
                left = Collections.min(window.values());
                window.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            
            // Update the max length
            max_len = Math.max(max_len, right - left);
        }
        
        return max_len;
    }
}
