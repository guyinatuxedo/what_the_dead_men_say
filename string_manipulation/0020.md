## Description

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

```
    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:

Input: "()"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:

Input: "([)]"
Output: false

Example 5:

Input: "{[]}"
Output: true
```

## Java Stack Solution

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea is, we iterate through the input array from right to left. Since open parentheses are left of the closing, we check if it is one of them. If it is, we add it to the stack. When we get to a closing parentheses, it's corresponding parentheses will be the last open parentheses seen. Which will be the top character on the stack. So we can just pop it off, and check if there's math. After the iteration is done, if the stack is not empty, that means one of the opening parentheses does not have a corresponding closing parentheses. In addition to that, we need to store the sequence at which we see opening parentheses, in case we are dealing with nested parentheses.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, since we iterate through the input characters. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(p)` where `p` is the number of opening parentheses, which comes from the stack. In the best case scenario where we don't see any parentheses, it's `O(1)`. In the worst case scenario which every character is an opening parentheses, it's `O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        char c, last;
        
        int n = s.length();
        Stack<Character> open_chars = new Stack<Character>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            c = s.charAt(i);
            
            // Open parentheses, add to stack
            if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[') {
                open_chars.push(c);
            }
            
            // Closing parentheses, check if last open matches
            else if (c == ')' || c == '}' || c == ']') {
                if (open_chars.isEmpty()) return false;
                last = open_chars.pop();
                if (last == '(' && c == ')') continue;
                if (last == '{' && c == '}') continue;
                if (last == '[' && c == ']') continue;
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // If stack is empty, valid parentheses
        return open_chars.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

## Java Stack Solution w/ HashSet

This solution is basically the same as my first one, it just has one small improvement I found from leetcode. We store the chars for the opening/closing parentheses in hashmaps, which we then use to check if a character is opening/closing a pair of parentheses.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        char c, last;
        
        int n = s.length();
        Stack<Character> chars = new Stack<Character>();
        
        // Make two hashsets which store opening/closing parentheses
        HashSet<Character> open = new HashSet<Character>();
        HashSet<Character> close = new HashSet<Character>();
        
        open.add('(');
        open.add('{');
        open.add('[');
        
        close.add(')');
        close.add('}');
        close.add(']');
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            c = s.charAt(i);
            
            if (open.contains(c)) {
                chars.push(c);
            }
            
            else if (close.contains(c)) {
                if (chars.isEmpty()) return false;
                last = chars.pop();
                if (last == '(' && c == ')') continue;
                if (last == '{' && c == '}') continue;
                if (last == '[' && c == ']') continue;
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return chars.isEmpty();
    }
}
```
