## Description

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

```
Example 1:

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"

Example 2:

Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"

Note:

    The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
    Both num1 and num2 contain only digits 0-9.
    Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
    You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
```

## Java "By Hand"

So with this problem, there is one problem that we have to take into account. The numbers we are dealing with are greater than the max value for an integer. As such, we can't just convert both strings to an integer, and multiply them (I tried that at first, it didn't work).

As such I basically just implemented the algorithm on how I was taught to do long multiplication by hand in grade school. I pick on a number, and for each digit in that number, I iterate through the other number, multiplying all of the digits by itself, and taking into account any carry value.

For storing the intermediate products (which all get summed up for the final product), I use a hashMap where the key is the digit index, and the value is the current summation of the products. Every time I add a product, I check for a carry value, and if there is one, I make a recursive call to it.

After I am finished adding together all of the products, I use a StringBuilder to build the output string.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n * m)` where `n/m` are the length in digits of the two inputs. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(2x)` -> (`O(x)` where `x` is the number of digits in the output string (since we have both the hashMap and the output string.)

```
class Solution {
    // This helper function is responsible for adding a product to the hashMap
    public void insertValue(HashMap<Integer, Integer> products, int value, int index)
    {
        int currentVal, carry;
        
        // Get the existing value at the spot we are adding
        currentVal = products.getOrDefault(index, 0);
        
        // Add the current value to the product
        value += currentVal;
        
        // Get the digit that will be stored, and the remainder
        carry = value / 10;
        value = value % 10;
        
        // Place the new digit in the map
        products.put(index, value);
        
        // Add the carry to the next spot over, if there is one
        if (carry != 0)
        {
            insertValue(products, carry, index + 1);
        }
    }
    
    public String multiply(String num1, String num2) {
        int x, y, n, m;
        String tmp;        
        
        // Our hashmap for storing the products
        // and stringbuilder for constructing the output string
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> products = new HashMap();
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();        

        // Grab the input lengths
        n = num1.length();
        m = num2.length();

        // Check if either input is 0
        if ((num1.equals("0")) || (num2.equals("0")))
        {
            output.append("0");
            return output.toString();
        }
        
        // Ensure that num2 has less than or equal digits to num1
        if (n < m)
        {
            tmp = num1;
            num1 = num2;
            num2 = tmp;
            
            
            n = num1.length();
            m = num2.length();
        }

        // For each digit of the smaller number
        // iterate through each digit of the larger number
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            {
                // Grab the number for this multiplication
                x = num1.charAt((n - 1) - j) - 0x30;
                y = num2.charAt((m - 1) - i) - 0x30;
                
                // Add the product to the current product
                insertValue(products, (x * y), i + j);
            
            }
        }            
        
        // Transform the final products to a string
        for (int key: products.keySet())
        {
            output.append(products.get(key));
        }
        return output.reverse().toString();
        
    }
}
