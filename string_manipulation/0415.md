## Description

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.

```
Note:

    The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100.
    Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
    Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
    You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
```

## Java Iterative String Concatenation

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is simple. At the same time we iterate through both input strings with two separate indices. The reason for the two indices is since they could have different lengths. We iterate from the back of the string forwards, since those are the numbers we add first. We just take the next number from both strings (or `0` from one if we've iterated past it's end), add them together plus the carry value. We update the carry value to its new value, and update the output with the new digit. If we've iterated through both strings, and we have a carry left over, we add that to the output before returning it.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(Math.max(n, m))`, since we iterate through both input strings at the same time. The memory cost which comes from the output string is also `O(Math.max(n, m))`:

```
class Solution {
    public String addStrings(String num1, String num2) {
        int i, j, n, m, x, y, z, carry;
        String output = "";
        
        n = num1.length();
        m = num2.length();

        i = n - 1;
        j = m - 1;
        carry = 0;
        while ((i >= 0) || (j >= 0)) {
            if (i >= 0) x = Integer.parseInt(num1.substring(i, i + 1));
            else x = 0;
                
            if (j >= 0) y = Integer.parseInt(num2.substring(j, j + 1));
            else y = 0;
            
            z = x + y + carry;
                
            carry = z / 10;
            
            output = Integer.toString(z % 10) + output;
            i--;
            j--;
        }
       
        if (carry != 0) output = Integer.toString(carry) + output;
        
        return output;
    }
}
```

## Java Iterative StringBuilder

This is pretty much the same solution as the above one. The only difference here, is I use a small optimization from leetcode. Instead of string concatenation, I use a stringbuilder.

```
class Solution {
    public String addStrings(String num1, String num2) {
        int i, j, n, m, x, y, z, carry;
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        
        n = num1.length();
        m = num2.length();

        i = n - 1;
        j = m - 1;
        carry = 0;
        while ((i >= 0) || (j >= 0)) {
            if (i >= 0) x = Integer.parseInt(num1.substring(i, i + 1));
            else x = 0;
                
            if (j >= 0) y = Integer.parseInt(num2.substring(j, j + 1));
            else y = 0;
            
            z = x + y + carry;
                
            carry = z / 10;
            
            output.append(Integer.toString(z % 10));
            i--;
            j--;
        }
       
        if (carry != 0) output.append(Integer.toString(carry));
        
        return output.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
