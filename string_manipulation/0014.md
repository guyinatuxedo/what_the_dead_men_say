## Description

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

## Java String Iteration

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. First off, we iterate through all of the strings, and find the length of the smallest string. If the length of the smallest string is zero, than there is no common prefix. Then I iterate through the first `n` characters of all of the strings, where `n` is the length of the smallest string. As I iterate through the characters, I check if the characters in the same index are equal, and if they are not I stop iterating through and return the prefix. If I iterate through without breaking, then that entire smallest string is the longest common prefix.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n + s)` where `n` is the length of the smallest string, and `s` is the number of strings. The `s` comes from finding the length of the smallest string. The `n` comes from finding the smallest common prefix of those strings. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution 
{
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) 
    {
        int n, j;
        
        n = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        j = 0;

        // Get the size and index of the shortest string
        for (int i = 0; i < strs.length; i++)
        {
            if (strs[i].length() < n) 
            {
                n = strs[i].length();
                j = i;
            }
        }
        
        // Check for empty input
        if (strs.length == 0) return new String();
        
        // If string with size 0, no common prefix
        if (n <= 0) return strs[j];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            // Iterate through the entire prefix
            char c = strs[0].charAt(i);
            for (String s: strs)
            {
                // Characters no longer match, prefix is over
                if (s.charAt(i) != c) return s.substring(0, i);
            }
        }

        // Entire shortest string is prefix
        return strs[j];
    }
}
