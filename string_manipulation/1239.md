## Description

Given an array of strings arr. String s is a concatenation of a sub-sequence of arr which have unique characters.

Return the maximum possible length of s.

## Java Recursion

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. I recurse through the input array. Every call will yield two additional calls. One will represent us skipping this word, which will just move onto the next one. The other will represent us adding this word to our string. We first check if it is allowed via checking for duplicate characters, both from the input stirng and in the word being added itself. If it is added successfully, we add it to the current word and move on. Once we iterate through the input path with one recursive call, we return the length of the current word.

```
class Solution {
    private int n;
    
    public int maxLength(List<String> arr) {
        n = arr.size();
        return hope(arr, "", 0);
    }
    
    private int hope(List<String> words, String current, int i) {
        // Check if we've reached the end
        if (i >= n) {
            return current.length();
        }
        
        int x, y;
        
        // Try pattern without this word
        x = hope(words, current, i + 1);
        
        String nextWord = words.get(i);
        HashSet<Character> repeat = new HashSet<Character>();
        Boolean valid = true;
        y = 0;
        
        // Check if we can add this word
        for (int j = 0; j < nextWord.length(); j++) {
            // Check if this will break the unique character limit
            if (current.contains(nextWord.substring(j, j + 1))) {
                y = current.length();
                valid = false
                break;
            }
            
            // Check if this word has no duplicate characters
            if (repeat.contains(nextWord.charAt(j))) {
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
            
            repeat.add(nextWord.charAt(j));
        }
        
        // Try pattern with this word added
        if (valid == true) {
            current += nextWord;
            y = hope(words, current, i + 1);
        }
        
        // Return greater length found
        return Math.max(x, y);
    }
}
```
