## Description

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

## Java Queue

So my solution here, revoles around storing the substring `s` in a queue. Then I iterate through the string `t`, checking if it has a character that is at the head of the queue. If it is, then we poll the head of the queue. If the queue becomes empty, we know it is a subsequence.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        Queue<Character> substring = new LinkedList<Character>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            substring.add(s.charAt(i));
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            if (substring.isEmpty()) return true;
            if (substring.peek() == t.charAt(i)) {
                substring.poll();
            }
        }
        
        return substring.isEmpty();
    }
}
```
