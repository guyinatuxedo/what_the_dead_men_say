## Description

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

## Java Single Pass

So my solution here involves a single pass through the input array. The idea behind it is each character, I check if the subsequent characters are repeated, and if so I count the number. If there are repeated characters, then I write the number to the array (I  have cases for the digit being one, and two characters). I also have two separate indices I keep, one for where I'm writing, and one for where I'm reading, since we have to modify the input array.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we just make a single pass, and the memory cost is `O(1)` since we just modify the input array.

```
class Solution 
{
    public int compress(char[] chars) 
    {
        char x;
        int y, j;
        j = 0;
        
        // Iterate through input array
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++)
        {
            x = chars[i];
            y = 1;
            
            // Count repeated characters
            while (((i + y) < (chars.length)) && (x == chars[i + y])) y++;
            
            // If we have repeated characters
            if (y > 1)
            {
                chars[j] = x;
                if (y <= 9)
                {
                    // Digit written is one character
                    chars[j + 1] = (char)((y) + 0x30);
                    i += (y - 1);
                    j +=2;
                }
                else
                {
                    // Digit written is two characters
                    chars[j + 1] = (char)((y / 10) + 0x30);
                    chars[j + 2] = (char)((y % 10) + 0x30);
                    i += (y - 1);
                    j += 3;
                }
            }
            
            else
            {
                // No repeated characters
                chars[j] = x;
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return j;
    }
}
```

## Java Two Pointers

So this solution revolves around having two indices. The first index indicates the spot we are checking for characters, the second is where we are writing to in the array, since we are editing in place. As we iterate through the string, we move the first index `i` forward by one every time. In addition to that we check for duplicates, and if there are we move it past the end of the duplicates. We then use the index `j` to write the number to the input array.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, since we iterate through each character of the input string. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int i, j, n, repeated;
        boolean compression;
        
        n = chars.length;
        j = 0;
        
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            repeated = 0;
            compression = false;
            chars[j] = chars[i];
            j++;
            
            while ((i < n - 1) && (chars[i] == chars[i + 1])) {
                repeated++;
                i++;
                compression = true;
            }
            
            if (compression == true){
                repeated++;
            
            System.out.println(repeated);
            
            if (repeated >= 1000) {
                chars[j] = (char)((repeated / 1000) + 0x30);
                repeated = repeated % 1000;
                j++;
            }
            
            if (repeated >= 100) {
                chars[j] = (char)((repeated / 100) + 0x30);
                repeated = repeated % 100;
                j++;
            }
            
            if (repeated >= 10) {
                chars[j] = (char)((repeated / 10) + 0x30);
                repeated = repeated % 10;
                j++;
            }
            
                chars[j] = (char)((repeated) + 0x30);
                j++;
            }
            }
        
        
        return j;
    }
}
```
