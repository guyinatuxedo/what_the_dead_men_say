## Description

Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer.

The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned.
```
Note:

    Only the space character ' ' is considered as whitespace character.
    Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (231 − 1) or INT_MIN (−231) is returned.

Example 1:

Input: "42"
Output: 42

Example 2:

Input: "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is '-', which is the minus sign.
             Then take as many numerical digits as possible, which gets 42.

Example 3:

Input: "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation: Conversion stops at digit '3' as the next character is not a numerical digit.

Example 4:

Input: "words and 987"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical 
             digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.

Example 5:

Input: "-91283472332"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
             Thefore INT_MIN (−231) is returned.
```

## Java Iterative Ascii Math

This solution is pretty simple. We start off by iterating through the beginning characters prior to the number. Proceeding that, we iterate through the integer portion, converting each character to a number. To convert a number, I check if it's within the Ascii integer value range, then if it is I convert it to decimal by subtracting `0x30` from it. If it isn't an Ascii numeric character, I return `-1` to indicate an error. I also run checks for overflow/underflow that are explained in section `003`.

The runtime analysis for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of characters in the input string. The memory cost is `O(1)` since the memory it takes are variables, with the amount being static.

```
class Solution {
    
    public int convertChar(char x)
    {
        // Check if it is a number from ascii
        if ((x >= '0') && (x <= '9'))
        {
            // Ascii integer value is the ascii value - 0x30
            return x - 0x30;
        }
        
        // Not an ascii integer character
        return -1;
    }
    
    public int returnValue(int x, boolean negative)
    {
        if (negative == true) x *= -1;
        return x;
    }
    
    public int myAtoi(String str) {
        int i, j, n, returnValue, value, checkValue, tmpValue;
        boolean negative,positive;
        char c;
        
        n = str.length();
        returnValue = 0;
        negative = positive = false;
        
        // Iterate through initial characters
        for (j = 0; j < n; j++)
        {
            c = str.charAt(j);
            if (c == ' ')
            {
                continue;
            }

            {
                j += 1;
                break;
            }
            
            if (c == '-')
            {
                negative = true;
                j += 1;
                break;
            }
            
            if ((c >= 0x30) && (c <= 0x39))
            {
                break;
            }

        // Iterate through input number portion of string
        for (i = j; i < n; i++)
        {
            // Get the numerical value of the current character
            value = convertChar(str.charAt(i));

            // Check for invalid character
            if ((value == -1))

            // Run the checks for overflow/underflow
            checkValue = returnValue;
            tmpValue = value;
            
            // If number is negative, we need to make the check values negative
            if (negative == true)
            {
                tmpValue = tmpValue * -1;
                checkValue = returnValue * -1;
            }
            
            if (checkValue > (Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10) || ((checkValue == (Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10)) && ((tmpValue) > 7)))
            {
                return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            }
            
            if (checkValue < (Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10) || ((checkValue == (Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10)) && ((tmpValue) < -8)))
