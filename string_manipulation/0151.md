## Description

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

## Java Iterate through String

So this was my initial solution to this challenge. I tried to not use any of the default java functionality that would have made this problem be solved really easily. The idea behind it is I parse out the words, and add them to a stack. I parse out words via iterating through all of the characters. If the character isn't a `' '`, I add it to the current substring. If it is, then I add the current substring to the stack. Then I just pop off the words from the stack which reversed them, into a stringbuilder.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of characters in the input string. The memory cost primarily comes from the stack, and the strings which we store in it. As such the memory cost would also come out around `O(n)`, however that varies depending on how many whitespace characters there are.

```
class Solution {
  public String reverseWords(String s) {
        char c;
        int x = 0;
      
        String sub = null;
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        Stack words = new Stack();

        // Check for empty input string
        if (s.equals("")) return s;
      
        // Iterate through each character of the string
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
        {
            // grab current character
            c = s.charAt(i);
            
            if (c == ' ')
            {
                // Add the string to the stack, we've reached the end
                if (sub != null)
                {
                    words.add(sub);
                    sub = null;
                    x += 1;
                }
                continue;
            }
            
            // Add the current character to the current sub string
            else
            {
                if (sub == null) sub = new String();
                sub += c;
            }
        }
      
        // Check if there is one string at the end
        // that needs to be added
        if (sub != null)
        {
            words.add(sub);
            x += 1;
        }
      
        // Check if there are no words
        if (words.isEmpty())
        {
            output.append("");
            return output.toString();
        }
      
        // Add all of the words, except the last
        // to output string
        for (int i = 0; i < (x - 1); i++)
        {
              output.append(words.pop() + " "); 
        }
      
      
        // Add final string, and return it
        output.append(words.pop());
        return output.toString();
  }
}
```

## Java Simple Solution

This is a simple solution that leverages the java functionality for doing this. It makes it really simple, and is from leetcode.

```
class Solution {
  public String reverseWords(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
            
        // Split up input into array of strings
        // Each string is separate word
        List<String> words = Arrays.asList(s.split("\\s+"));
      
        // Reverse the words
        Collections.reverse(words);
      
        // Rejoin the words together
        return String.join(" ", words);
  }
}
```
