## Description

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

## Java HashMaps and Array

This was my first solution to this challenge. With this, we need to check if the positioning of characters are the same in the two strings, abstracted from what specific characters they are.

First off I check if the length of the two strings are the same, since if they aren't they can't be isomorphic.

Next I get the positioning of the characters for the two strings. I do this using a hashMap. I iterate through each character of the string, and store the index at which we first see that in a hashMap. As I'm doing it, I also populate an array where the value represents the first index at which we say the character at that spot. I do that for both strings so we have the positioning, then I compare the positions via comparing the arrays.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(3n)` -> `O(n)`where `n` is the size of either string (since if they aren't the same size, I exit the algorithm early). The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(4n)` -> `O(n)` because of the two hashMaps and the two Arrays.

class Solution 
{
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) 
    {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> mapping0 = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> mapping1 = new HashMap<>();

        // If lengths are not the same, they cannot be isomorphic
        if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;
        
        int n = s.length();
        int[] pos0 = new int[n];
        int[] pos1 = new int[n];
        int x;
        
        // Get Positioning for first string
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            x = mapping0.getOrDefault(s.charAt(i), -1);
            if (x == -1)
            {
                mapping0.put(s.charAt(i), i);
                pos0[i] = i;
            }
            else pos0[i] = x;
        }

        // Get Positioning for second string
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            x = mapping1.getOrDefault(t.charAt(i), -1);
            if (x == -1)
            {
                mapping1.put(t.charAt(i), i);
                pos1[i] = i;
            }
            else pos1[i] = x;
        }
        
        // Check if positioning is the same
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (pos0[i] != pos1[i]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
