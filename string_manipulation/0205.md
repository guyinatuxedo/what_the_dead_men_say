## Description

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

## Java HashMaps and Array

This was my first solution for this problem. The idea behind it is this. We have a HashMap for both input strings. The key to it is a character, and the value is the last index at which we've seen that character. We first check to ensure that both strings have the same length (if they don't, there is no way they can be isomorphic). After that, we iterate through both arrays.

We first check to see if we've seen the character before in either hashmap. If so, we compare the last seen index. If they are the same, we continue moving. If not, we know the order of the characters does not allow for them to be isomorphic. Every time we see a character, we update it's last seen index in the hashmap. By doing this we can effectively treat each character as a variable, and that the ordering of those variables is the same.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, since we iterate through both input strings at the same time. The memory cost which stems from the hashmaps is `O(2n) -> O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        int n = s.length();
        int j, k;
        
        // If lengths are not the same, strings are not isomorphic
        if (n != t.length()) return false;
        
        char x, y;
        
        HashMap<Character, Integer> mappingS = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> mappingT = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Get the current character, and corresponding indices
            x = s.charAt(i);
            y = t.charAt(i);
            
            j = mappingS.getOrDefault(x, -1);
            k = mappingT.getOrDefault(y, -1);
            
            // Check if we've seen it before
            if (j != -1 || k != -1) {
                // Check if the last seen indices are the same
                if (j != k) {
                    return false;
                }
            }

            // Update the last seen indices
            mappingS.put(x, i);
            mappingT.put(y, i);
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
