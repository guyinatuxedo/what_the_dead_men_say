## Description

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

## Java HashMaps and Array

This was my first solution for this problem. The idea behind it is this. We have a HashMap for both input strings. The key to it is a character, and the value is a unique value we assign to that character. We first check to ensure that both strings have the same length (if they don't, there is no way they can be isomorphic). After that, we iterate through both arrays.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, since we iterate through both input strings at the same time. The memory cost which stems from the hashmaps is `O(2n) -> O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map0, map1;
        int i, j, k, n;
        Character char0, char1;
        
        if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;
        n = s.length();
        
        j = k = 0;
        map0 = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        map1 = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char0 = s.charAt(i);
            char1 = t.charAt(i);
            if (!map0.containsKey(char0)) {
                map0.put(char0, j);
                j += 1;
            }
            
            if (!map1.containsKey(char1)) {
                map1.put(char1, k);
                k += 1;
            }
            
            if (map0.get(char0) != map1.get(char1)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
