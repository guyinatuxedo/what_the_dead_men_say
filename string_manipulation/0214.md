## Description

Given a string s, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

## Java Iterative

The idea behind this solution is this. We can only add characters to the left of this string. As such, the beginning of the palindrome must be at the start of the string. So we can just iterate through the string from the back to the front. If we encounter a character that is the same as the starting character, we just check if that is the beginning of a palindrome. If it is, then we just add the characters to the right, to the front (reversed). If not, then we continue iterating.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(String s, int i) {
        int x = 0;
        while (x < i) {
            if (s.charAt(x) != s.charAt(i)) return false;
            x += 1;
            i -= 1;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    public String createSubstring(String s, int i) {
        int n = s.length();
        StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();
        for (int j = n - 1; i < j; j--) {
            output.append(s.charAt(j));
        }
        
        for (int j = 0; j <= n - 1; j++) {
            output.append(s.charAt(j));
        }
        
        return output.toString();
    }
    
    
    public String shortestPalindrome(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(i)) {
                if (isPalindrome(s, i)) {
                    return createSubstring(s, i);                    
                }
            }

        }
        return s;
    }
}
```

## Java Recursive

This solution was from leetcode. The idea behind this solution, is we take an approach similar to the above one, but optimized. We eliminate portions of the string that we know aren't a palindrome.

We do this via having two indices. The first index points to the beginning of the string, the second points to the end. We iterate the second index backwards through the string. Each time we check if it is equal to the character pointed to by the first index (since it starts at `0` it has to point to the start of the index), and if it is equal, we move the first index forward by one. By the time we are done iterating through, we know that the characters to the right of the first index cannot be a part of the palindrome. So we can just make a recursive call to the portion of the string to the left, while encasing it in the characters to the right of the index. If there are no characters to the right of the index, then we know the entire string is a palindrome, and we return that.

```
class Solution {
    // Helper function to reverse strings
    public String reverseString(String s) {
        char[] result = new char[s.length()];
        int n = s.length();
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result[j] = s.charAt(i);
            j++;
        }
        
        return new String(result);
    }
    
    public String shortestPalindrome(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int i = 0;
        
        // Find the index past which we know is not a palindrome
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        // See if we've reached the palindrome portion
        if (i == n) return s;
        
        // Get the non-palindrome characters
        String x = reverseString(s.substring(i));
        String y = s.substring(i);
        
        return x + shortestPalindrome(s.substring(0, i)) + y;
    }
}
```
