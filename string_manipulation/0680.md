## Description

Given a non-empty string s, you may delete at most one character. Judge whether you can make it a palindrome. 

## Java String Iteration

Initially when I was trying to solve this, what I would do is check if the string is a valid palindrome. Once I reached two characters that didn't match, I checked if either of the adjacent characters matched so I could delete. Then I would continue along and ensure everything else matches.

Now the issue is this, is scenarios where we could delete either character on either end and it would pass that character check. However later down the line, there would be one character deletion that would work and one that would not. So when we are faced with the choice of which character we want to delete, we have to check if either substring is a valid palindrome versus just simply deleting a character and moving on. This idea was from leetcode.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`.


```
class Solution 
{
    public boolean isValidPalindrome(String s, int i, int j)
    {
        // Check if the substring is a valid palindrome
        // with no character deletions
        for (int k = i; k <= i + (j - i) / 2; k++)
        {
            if (s.charAt(k) != s.charAt((j + i) - k)) return false;
        }
                
        return true;
    }
                
    public boolean validPalindrome(String s) 
    {
        int j;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() / 2; i++)
        {
            if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(s.length() - 1 - i))
            {
                // We reached a letter that needs to be deleted
                // Check if deleting a character will make it valid
                j = s.length() - 1 - i;
                return (isValidPalindrome(s, i + 1, j) || isValidPalindrome(s, i, j - 1));
            }
        }
        return true;        
    }
}    
```
