## Description

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

## Java Binary Search

So the idea behind this solution is to do two binary searches. The first one is to find the smallest element in the array, which should be the start of the array if it was sorted. The second binary search is to actually find the element.

When we do the second binary search, there are three cases. The first is when the array isn't shifted at all (happens when the index returned from the first binary search is for a greater value then the start of the array). 

With a shifted array, in reality we have two sorted arrays that are merged in a way which they aren't sorted. For the final two cases, it's just if the value is in one of them, or another. We can check for this via comparing it to the first element.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(2 * log(n))`, since we do two binary searches each `O(log(n))` instructions. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

    // Helper function to do binary search

        int middle = ((rightIndex - leftIndex) / 2) + leftIndex;
        while ((nums[middle] != value))
        {
            if (nums[middle] > value)
            {
                rightIndex = middle;
            }
