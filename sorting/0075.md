## Description

Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.


## Java Two Pass Counting Sort

So the idea for this solution is two passes through the input array. The first pass we count the number of colors. Then we add the previous colors to the future colors, which sets the counts to the `1 +` the max index where we will see the color. Then with the second pass through the input array, we overwrite the array with the proper colors (we know the indices from the previous pass of all of the sorted colors).

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(2*n)` -> `O(n)` which comes from the two passes through the input array. The memory cost is `O(1)`, which mainly comes from the fact that we know that there are only three colors we have to sort, so we can just use a static amount of variables, with fixed sizes.

```
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums)
    {
        int red, white, blue;
        red = white = blue = 0;
        
        // Array to count our colors
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            if (nums[i] == 0) red++;
            else if (nums[i] == 1) white++;
            else if (nums[i] == 2) blue++;
        }
        
        // Set red/white/blue to the index which represents
        // the max color index + 1
        white += red;
        blue += white;

        // Assign the colors
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            if (i < red) nums[i] = 0;
            else if (i < white) nums[i] = 1;
            else nums[i] =2;
        }
    }
}
```

## Java One Pass Dutch National Flag Problem

So this algorithm is an optimized version from leetcode. The algorithm is from Dijkstra. It's optimized since it only requires one pass through the input array. The idea behind the algorithm is this. We keep three indexes as we pass through the array. Two represent the boundaries for red, and blue colors. The third is the current element when we iterate. If the current element is red, we stick in the left side, if the current element is blue, we stick it in the blue side. If it is white, we leave it for now, since those should be in the middle.

When we stick a color at one of the ends, we are swapping the values at the two locations. Also we only move the current index forward when we run into a red or white color. The reason for that being, when we swap out a red color, we aren't sure that the color we are swapping with isn't red, so we need to check that.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`

```
class Solution 
{
  public void sortColors(int[] nums) 
  {
      int i, redLimit, whiteLimit, tmp;
      
      // Initialize the boundaries, and the current index
      i = redLimit = 0;
      whiteLimit = nums.length - 1;
      
      // Pass through the array
      while (i <= whiteLimit)
      {
          // We found a red
          if (nums[i] == 0)
          {
              nums[i] = nums[redLimit]; 
              nums[redLimit] = 0;
  
              redLimit++;
              i++;
          }
          
          // We found a blue
          else if (nums[i] == 2)
          {
              nums[i] = nums[whiteLimit];   
              nums[whiteLimit] = 2;
              whiteLimit--;
          }
          
          // We found a white
          else i++;
      }
  }
}
```
