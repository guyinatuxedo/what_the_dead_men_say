## Description

Given a positive integer n, find and return the longest distance between any two adjacent 1's in the binary representation of n. If there are no two adjacent 1's, return 0.

Two 1's are adjacent if there are only 0's separating them (possibly no 0's). The distance between two 1's is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two 1's in "1001" have a distance of 3.

## Java Anding

So for this solution, we check individual bits via anding the input with a value that only has one bit set. I use this to identify which bits are sent. As I iterate through the bits, I keep track of the distances between 1s, and check for the max distance. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(1)`, since there is a constant amount of bits which we iterate through. The memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int binaryGap(int n) {
        int x, count, max;
        boolean seen1;
        
        x = 1;
        seen1 = false;
        count = max = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((x & n) != 0) {
                if (seen1 == true) count += 1;
                max = Math.max(max, count);
                count = 0;
                seen1 = true;
            }
            
            else if (seen1 == true) {
                count += 1;
            }
            
            x = (x << 1);
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```
