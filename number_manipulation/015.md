## Java HashMap

So this solution is sort of similar to the one from `001`. However this has some added complexities.

This algorithm is sort of similar to the one from `001`. In that one, we iterate through the array, and looked at the difference between the target and each value of the input, and checked if there was a matching value. Here we do something similar, where we have a nested for loop, and the outer for loop determines the target. The main issue here that we have to deal with by doing that is duplicates.

We can deal with that partially with how we structure our for loops. The outer for loop will iterate through the entire input array. However the inner for loop will only iterate through the proceeding element for the outer loop to the end of the array. That way when we are done checking if an element as a target, we are done with that element entirely. This also helps with the issue of having duplicate values at multiple places in the input.

In addition to that, we will be storing the tripplets we come up with in a HashMap. We will be storring the greatest, and least greates values. That way if we come up with a new set of tripplets, we can check if we already have found those tripplets. Now the reason why we only need the greatest and least greatest, is because when you add those two constants together, there is only one possible constant that can come as a result. As such, there isn't a need to store the middle value.

In terms of the inner loop, it will look pretty similar to the `Hashmap One-Pass` from `001`. Effectively we calculate the constant needed for us to have a valid tripplet, and check to see if it exists in the hashmap. As we iterate through that portion of the array (since we start at the element after `i`), we add each element we encounter to a hashmap. That way we only need to make one pass through that potion of the array, for each iteration of the inner for loop.

```
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {
        int target, min, max;
        
        // Make our output array and found hashSet
        List<List<Integer>> solutions = new ArrayList<>();
        Set<Pair> found = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            // Make the hashSet
            Set<Integer> available = new HashSet<>();
            
            // Iterate through the sub array for this iteration
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++)
            {
                // Get the constant which will make this a solution
                target = -nums[i] - nums[j];
                
                // Check if that constant exists in the hashSet
                if (available.contains(target))
                {
                    // Get the min / max values for this solution
                    min = Math.min(nums[i], Math.min(nums[j], target));
                    max = Math.max(nums[i], Math.max(nums[j], target));
                    
                    // Check if that solution has been found already
                    if (found.add(new Pair (min, max)))
                    {
                        // Add this solution
                        solutions.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[j], target));
                    }
                }
                
                // Add this number to the hashSet
                available.add(nums[j]);
            }
        }
        return solutions;
    }
}
```

However to this, there are a few optimizations we can make. First off, we can change the hashSet to a hashMap, that is initialized at the beginning, and the value that is stored is it's index. Then when we are checking if that exists in the hashMap, we also check if the index is the same, to confirm it came from this iteration. In addition to that, we make a seperate hashSet that will store numbers that we have checked as a target, to reduce duplicate checks.

The runtime cost for both of these algorithms is `O(n^2)`. The memory cost associated with both is `O(n^2)` for the optimized algorithm, since we insert every element around `n` times.

```
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {
        int target, min, max;
        
        // Make our output array and found hashSet
        List<List<Integer>> solutions = new ArrayList<>();
        Set<Pair> found = new HashSet<>();

        // Make the hashMap
        Map<Integer, Integer> available = new HashMap<>();
        Set<Integer> checked = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {            
            if (checked.add(nums[i]))
            {
            // Iterate through the sub array for this iteration
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++)
            {
                // Get the constant which will make this a solution
                target = -nums[i] - nums[j];
                
                // Check if that constant exists in the hashSet
                if (available.containsKey(target) && available.get(target) == i)
                {
                    // Get the min / max values for this solution
                    min = Math.min(nums[i], Math.min(nums[j], target));
                    max = Math.max(nums[i], Math.max(nums[j], target));
                    
                    // Check if that solution has been found already
                    if (found.add(new Pair (min, max)))
                    {
                        // Add this solution
                        solutions.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[j], target));
                    }
                }
                
                // Add this number to the hashSet
                available.put(nums[j], i);
            }
        }
        }
        return solutions;
    }
}
