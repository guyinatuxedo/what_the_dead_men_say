## Description

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## Java HashMap OnePass

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We make a single pass through the input array. For each number the input array, we subtract it from the target number to get the difference. If the difference is equal to another number, the input array, then we know the two numbers at which make the two sum. We use a HashMap for this, where the key is the number, and the value is the index. if the difference isn't found in the HashMap, then we add it to the HashMap and move on.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost which stems from the HashMap is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array:

```
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> seenValues = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        int n, x, seen;
        int[] output = new int[2];
        
        n = nums.length;
        
        // Check for empty input
        if (n <= 0) return output;
        
        // Iterate through input array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Calculate the difference needed for solution
            x = target - nums[i];
            seen = seenValues.getOrDefault(x, -1);
            
            // If we've seen the difference, we've found the two indices
            if (seen != -1) {
                output[0] = i;
                output[1] = seen;
                return output;
            }
            
            // Add this number to the list of numbers we've seen
            seenValues.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        
        return output;
        
    }
}
```
