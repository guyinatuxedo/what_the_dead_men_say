## Java Summation

So my idea for this solution is pretty simple. For all elements of the output array, we set it's value equal to it's index. This guarantees that each value is unique. While we do this, we store the summation of all of the values in a variable. Then for the last value, we set it equal to the summation of all of the previous elements times `-1`, so the total summation ends up being `0`.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the input integer, because of the for loop. The memory cost is also `O(n)` because we return a new array of size `n`.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] sumZero(int n) {
        int x = 0;
        int[] output = new int[n];
        
        // Set all elements in the array
        // equal to the index, add  up
        // all of the values
        for (int i = 0; i < (n - 1); i++)
        {
            output[i] = i;
            x += i;
        }

        // Set the last value equal to the 
        // summation of all previous values
        // plus one
        output[n - 1] = -(x);
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
