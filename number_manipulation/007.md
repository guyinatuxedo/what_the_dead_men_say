## Description

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

```
Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321

Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321

Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21
```

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [âˆ’231,  231 âˆ’ 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Solution Java Math

So this solution effectively just grabs a digit from the input via modding it by 10, and adds it to the reversed via adding (after multiplying the reversed number by 10). 

The checks for an int overflow/underflow are really the tricky part here. I leverage leetcode for help. There are two real cases we can check for int overflows/underflows each. We check it prior to incrementing the reversed integer. Since the reversed integer will be multiplied by `10`, we can first check if that will cause an overflow/underflow. In the second case for both, is when multiplying by `10` will have our reversed integer end up right by the max/min for integers, so then we just check if the number we are adding will cause an overflow/underflow.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of digits within `x` (which should roughly come out to be around `O(log(x))`). The memory cost is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        // Declare and initialize our variables
        int reversed, tmp;
        
        reversed = tmp = 0;
        
        while (x != 0)
        {
            // Grab what the next integer to be added is
            tmp = x  % 10;            
            
            // Check for overflow / underflow
            if ((reversed > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10) || ((reversed == (Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10)) && ((tmp) > 7)))
            {
                return 0;
            }
            
            if ((reversed < (Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10)) || ((reversed == (Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10)) && ((tmp) < -8)))
            {
                return 0;
            }
            
            // Add the number to the reversed number
            reversed *= 10;
            reversed += tmp;
            
            // Decrement the input number
            x = x / 10;
        }
        
        return reversed;
    }
}
```

## Solution Java String/Int Conversion

So this solution is a more hacky way to do it, that's less efficient. The premise is we convert the number to a string, reverse the string, and convert it back. Those string/integer conversions is where we loose on the performance here.

For checking for an overflow/underflow, I first check if the number of digits in the reversed string is greater than that of the max/min integers. If they're the same, then I do a comparison using BigIntegers. Since they have more bits than Integers, they can just do the comparison normally.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is still `O(n)`, however there are more `O(n)` operations thanks to the type conversions (where `n` is the number of digits in `x`). The memory cost is `O(n)` since we have to allocate that space for the strings for the reversal..

```
import java.math.BigInteger;

class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        // Declare / initialize our values
        int i;
        boolean negative;
        String inputString, reversed;
        
        // Check if it's negative
        negative = x < 0;
        
        // Get the absolute value of the input number
        x = Math.abs(x);
        
        // Convert it to a string
        inputString = Integer.toString(x);
        
        // Reverse the string
        reversed = "";
        
        for (i = 0; i < inputString.length(); i++)
        {
            reversed = inputString.charAt(i) + reversed;
        }
        
        // Check if it's going to cause an overflow/underflow
        if (i > 10)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        
        if (i == 10)
        {
            // Use BigIntegers for checks of same number of digits as max/min values
            BigInteger maxInt = BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
            BigInteger minInt = BigInteger.valueOf(Integer.MIN_VALUE);
            BigInteger check  = new BigInteger(reversed);
            
            if ((check.compareTo(maxInt) > 0) || (check.compareTo(minInt) < 0))
            {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        
        if (negative != true)
        {        
            return Integer.valueOf(reversed);
        }
        
        // Input was negative
        return Integer.valueOf(reversed) * -1;        
        
    }
}
```
