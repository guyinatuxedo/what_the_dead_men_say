## Description

Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.

But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.

## Java Modding Iteration

So my solution to this is pretty simple. The idea behind it is we check if `x` is divisible by `y` via modding and checking if the output is `0`.  I check for the three different conditions at which we will add a different string. If not, we add the numeric representation of the current number. I check for all the numbers via a for loop.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we iterate in a for loop from `1` to `n`. The memory cost is `O(n)` since the output is an ArrayList of strings, which has `n` elements. Disregarding the output, the memory cost is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution 
{
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) 
    {
        // Our output string
        List<String> output = new ArrayList<String>();
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++)
        {
            // Check if a string needs to be added
            if ((i % 3 == 0) && (i % 5 == 0)) output.add("FizzBuzz");
            else if (i % 3 == 0) output.add("Fizz");
            else if (i % 5 == 0) output.add("Buzz");
            
            // Add the numeric string
            else  output.add(Integer.toString(i));
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
