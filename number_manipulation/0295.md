## Description

Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.
For example,

```
[2,3,4], the median is 3

[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5
```

## Java Sorting

So this is a pretty simple solution. The idea behind it, is we have an ArrayList which stores all of the numbers. The idea behind it, is whenever we insert into the ArrayList, we also sort it. That way whenever we need to calculate the median, we only need to go for the middle.

```
class MedianFinder {
    ArrayList<Integer> store;
    
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    public MedianFinder() {
        store = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    }
    
    public void addNum(int num) {
        store.add(num);
        Collections.sort(store);
    }
    
    public double findMedian() {
        int n = store.size();
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return ((double)store.get((n / 2) - 1) + store.get((n / 2))) / 2;
        }
        
        else {
            return store.get(n / 2);
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MedianFinder obj = new MedianFinder();
 * obj.addNum(num);
 * double param_2 = obj.findMedian();
 */
```
