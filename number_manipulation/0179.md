## Description

Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

```
Example 1:

Input: [10,2]
Output: "210"

Example 2:

Input: [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"

Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
```

## Java Sorting

So the original solution I tried to do, involved sorting the input array as numbers. I would look at the most significant digits to determine the ordering. In the instance that both most significant digits were equal, I would look to the lower digits. This however didn't always work in instances where two numbers shared all of the same most significant digits, but one number had more digits.

So the solution I implemented was off of leetcode. This solution revolves around converting the input to strings, then doing the compares to sort it. This has the advantage over my original method, with the fact that we can compare the number is the positions that they would appear in the output. After sorting the input, we can just combine the sorted strings together to have the output.

For this, we make our own comparator that implements Java's `Comparator` and Overrides the `compare` method. We just check the ordering between two strings, to see which one is greater. We use this as the comparator for sorting.

There is one edge case for doing it this way. When the first character of the sorted input is `0`, then the output is `0`.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n*log(n) + 2n` -> `O(log(n) * n)` because of the sorting, the string conversion, and constructing the output. the memory cost is `O(2 * n)` -> `O(n)`because we allocate a string for each number for `strs`, and we have to allocate the output string.

```
class Solution {
    // Our comparator for sorting
    private class LargerNumberComparator implements Comparator<String>
    {
        @Override
        public int compare(String x, String y)
        {
            String str0 = x + y;
            String str1 = y + x;
            return str1.compareTo(str0);
        }
    }
    public String largestNumber(int[] nums) 
    {
        // Convert input nums to strings
        String[] strs = new String[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
        {
            strs[i] = String.valueOf(nums[i]);
        }
        
        // Sort the array using our comparator
        Arrays.sort(strs, new LargerNumberComparator());
        
        // Check if first character is '0'
        if (strs[0].equals("0")) return "0";
        
        // Construct and return the output
        String output = new String();
        for (String str: strs)
        {
            output += str;
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
