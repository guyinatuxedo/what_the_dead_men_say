## Description

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

```
Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Java Palindrome Check

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We convert the input number to an array. Then we recurse through half of the array, checking if the corresponding digits on the other side of the array are equal. Also if the input number is negative, there is no way it can be a palindrome.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of digits, since that is what we iterate through. The memory cost which stems from the int array is also `O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        // If negative, not a palindrome
        if (x < 0) return false;
        
        int transfer = x;
        int n = 0;
        
        // Count the digits in transfer
        while (transfer > 0) {
            n += 1;
            transfer /= 10;
        }
        
        int[] nums = new int[n];
        transfer = x;
        
        // Store the digits in nums
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            nums[i] = transfer % 10;
            transfer /= 10;
        }
        
        // Check if the digits make a palindrome
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[(n - 1) - i]) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
            
    }
}
```

## Java Integer Reversal

This was my second solution to this problem, which is more optimized then the first. It revolves around reversing the input number, and then checking if the reverse is equal to the input. Again if the number is negative, it cannot be a palindrome. To grab digits from the input, we mod by `10`. To add digits to the reverse, we multiply it by `10` then add the new digit.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of digits. The memory cost is reduced to `O(1)` since we just use a static amount of variables.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        // If negative, not a palindrome
        if (x < 0) return false;
        
        int transfer, reversal;
        
        transfer = x;
        reversal = 0;
        
        // Generate the reversed number
        while (transfer > 0) {
            reversal = (reversal * 10) + (transfer % 10);
            transfer /= 10;
        }
        
        // Check if the reversed number is equal to the input
        return reversal == x;
    }
}
}
```

## Java Integer Reversal Half

So this algorithm was an improved one from leetcode. It's the same concept, however it's improved. In the earlier algorithm, I copied the input value to a variable and decremented that during this reversal. This algorithm just directly decrements the input. That way, we only need to reverse half of the integer, since the value we are comparing it to is the other half.

Now when we do this, and if the number of digits is odd, then the reversed int will have one extra digit then the integer it's being compared to. We can just divide it by zero to disregard it (because in a palindrome, only the middle digit matters).

We also need to have a check for numbers that when modded by `10` give us zero, since that will cause a bug with the algorithm. This is because `x` is set equal to `x / 10`, it will be equal to `0`, which will also be what `reversal` is equal to.

The runtime cost is still `(O(n))` where `n` is the number of digits, however in this instance we only need to iterate through half of the digits versus all of them, so it leads to a slower linear increase. The memory cost is still `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        // If 0, is positive
        if (x == 0) return true;
        
        // If negative, not a palindrome
        // Check for %10 edge case
        if ((x < 0) || (x % 10 == 0)) return false;
        
        int reversal;
        
        reversal = 0;
        
        // Generate the reversed number
        while (x > reversal) {
            reversal = (reversal * 10) + (x % 10);
            x /= 10;
        }
        
        // Check if the reversed number is equal to the input
        return reversal == x || x == reversal / 10;
    }
}
```
