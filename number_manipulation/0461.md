## Description

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

## Java Bit Anding

So this solution, we iterate through all 32 bits, checking if each one is set with the two inputs via anding. We then count and return the number of different bits:

```
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int z, output;
        boolean xSet, ySet;
        
        z = 0x1;
        output = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            xSet = ((x & z) != 0);
            ySet = ((y & z) != 0);
            
            if (xSet != ySet) output += 1;
            z = z << 1;
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
