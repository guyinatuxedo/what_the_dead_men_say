## Description

Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

```
Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.

Example 2:

Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321
```

## Java Math Solution

So this was my initial solution. Essentially I start iterating through the input digits, from the least significant digit. I add the digit to carry (initialized to `1` because that is what we add). I check to see if there is a carry digit to the next bit, and if so I iterate to the next character. If the number of digits returned is greater than the number of digits inputted, I allocate a new array to store the values.

In terms of runtime analysis, it is an `O(n)` algorithm, where `O(n)` is the worst case. The best case scenario is `O(1)` where there is no carry over. In terms of memory consumption, if there isn't a carry over of the most significant digit, then it is `O(1)`. If there is, then due to the new array allocated, that memory cost becomes `O(n)`.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        int i, sum, carry;
        
        // Grab the length
        i = digits.length - 1;
        
        // Set the carry value to the value being added
        carry = 1;
        
        // Iterate until we reach the end of digits, or end the addition
        while ((i >= 0) && (carry != 0))
        {
            
            sum = carry + digits[i];
            
            // Check for a carry over
            if (sum > 9)
            {
                carry = 1;
                sum = sum % 10;
            }
            
            // No carry over
            else carry = 0;
                
            // Edit the value in digits
            digits[i] = sum;
            
            i = i - 1;
        }
        
        // This is for when due to a carry over
        // There are more digits being returned than inputted
        // New array must be allocated
        if (carry != 0)
        {
            int newDigits[];
            newDigits = new int[digits.length + 1];
            newDigits[0] = carry;
            return newDigits;
        }

        return digits;
    }
}
```

## Java 1 Based Math

So this solution is the one that was from leetcode, and is a bit more optimized for this scenario. It is similar to my solution above, however it only focuses on what if we add one, which in this instance is the only number that could be added. The thing is since we are only adding one, the only instance which a number will carry over is if it's `9`, so we can just check for that. If it isn't `9`, then we just increment it.

The runtime and memory costs are the same. 

```
class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        
        // Iterate until we reach the end of digits
        for (int i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            // If digit is not 9, we can end the algorithm
            if (digits[i] != 9)
            {
                digits[i]++;
                return digits;
            }
            
            // We have a carry over
            digits[i] = 0;
        }
        
        // This is for when due to a carry over
        // There are more digits being returned than inputted
        // New array must be allocated
        if (digits[0] == 0)
        {
            int newDigits[];
            newDigits = new int[digits.length + 1];
            newDigits[0] = 1;
            return newDigits;
        }

        return digits;
    }
}
```
