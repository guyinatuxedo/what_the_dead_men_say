## Description

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

```
Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321

Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321

Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21
```

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Java Digit Iteration

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea is that we numerically iterate backwards through the digits of the input. Since we are dealing with base 10 numbers, we can get the least significant digit of a number via modding it by `10`. Then we can add it to the output as the least significant digit, via multiplying the output by `10` to make room for another digit, then simply adding it. To decrement the input so the next digit will be the least significant, we can divide it by `10`.

To make things simpler, I have a check which stores the sign of the input as either a `1` or a `-1`. That way I can convert the input to its absolute value, run it through the iteration, then multiply it by it's sign to restore it's correct sign.

Now to check for overflow, we have to look at the formula for how we increment the output:

```
(output * 10) + transfer <= Integer.MAX_VALUE
```

So we can just do a bit of algebra to get a check to see if `output` will give us an overflow. We want `output` on one side, so this check doesn't overflow:

```
output > (Integer.MAX_VALUE - transfer) / 10
```

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of digits in the input string. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)` since we just use constant variables.

```
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        int transfer, output, sign;
        
        // Simpler if we deal with only a positive number
        // Save the sign in the sign int
        sign = (x < 0) ? -1: 1;
        x = Math.abs(x);
        
        output = 0;
        while (x != 0) {
            // Get the next number to be added
            transfer = x % 10;
            
            // Check for an overflow
            if (output > (Integer.MAX_VALUE - transfer) / 10) return 0;
            
            // Add the next number to the output
            output = (output * 10) + transfer;
            
            // Decrement the least significant digit from x
            x /= 10;
        }
        
        // Return the output with correct sign
        return output*sign;
    }
}
```

## Java String/Int Conversion

This is my second solution to this problem, and is a bit of a hack. The idea behind it is we just convert it to a string, reverse the string, then return the numerical value. We do the same thing with the sign as the above solution. The main difference is how we check for an overflow. If the number of input digits is greater than `10`, we know there is an overflow (because `Integer.MAX_VALUE` has `10` digits). If the number of digits is below `10`, we know there cannot be an overflow. If the number of digits is `10`, then we have to check for an overflow. To do this, I first check if the first `9` digits are greater than the first `9` digits of the `Integer.MAX_VALUE` value of `2147483647`, since we can check that numerically with ints without risking an overflow. If it's greater than, it's an overflow. If it's less than, there isn't an overflow. If they're equal, we then check the last digit to determine if it is an overflow.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n^2)`, since there are `O(n)` `substring()` call which is an `O(n)` operation. The memory cost of this algorithm is `O(n)` because of the strings.

```
class Solution {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        String inputAsString = Integer.toString(x);
        int sign, check, n;
        n = inputAsString.length();
        
        String output = "";
        
        // Parse out negative sign
        if (inputAsString.charAt(0) == '-') {
            sign = -1;
            inputAsString = inputAsString.substring(1);
            n -= 1;
        }
        
        else {
            sign = 1;
        }

        // If len > 10, it will cause overflow
        if (n > 10) return 0;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            output += inputAsString.substring(i, i+1);
        }

        // If length == 10, we need to check for overflow
        if (n == 10) {
            // Check the higher digits, can be done numerically without overflow
            check = Integer.parseInt(output.substring(0, 9));
            if (check > 214748364) return 0;
            
            // Last digit determines if it is an overflow
            if (check == 214748364) {
                if (Integer.parseInt(output.substring(9, 10)) > 7) return 0;
            }
        }
        
        return Integer.parseInt(output) * sign;
    }
}
```
