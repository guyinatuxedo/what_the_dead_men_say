## Description

Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

## Java Bit Iteration

So for this, we iterate through the bits, and flipping them in the output. Since we don't count leading zeroes, we begin once we hit a 1. The runtime and memory cost of this algorithm is `O(1)`:

```
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int output, working;
        boolean began;
        
        began = false;
        working = 0x40000000;
        output = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((working & num) != 0) {
                began = true;
            }
            
            else if (began) {
                output |= working;
            }
            
            working = working >> 1;
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
