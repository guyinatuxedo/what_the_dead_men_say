## Description

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

## Java Bit Reversal

So this was my first solution to the problem. The idea is this. We parse out each bit from the input number via binary shifting and anding. Then using binary shifting we move it to the reverse spot, then or it back into the output. The runtime and memory cost for this algorithm are both `O(1)` (for loop runs static times, 32 times for 32 bit integers).

```
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int output, x;
        output = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            // Get Current bit
            x = ((n >> i) & 1);
            
            // Adjust bit to reverse position
            x = x << (31 - i);
            
            // Or in value to output
            output = output | x;
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
