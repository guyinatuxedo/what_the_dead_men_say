## Description

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

```
Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Java Integer Reversal

So my solution for this is pretty simple. Essentially I just reverse the integer, and then compare it against the input to see if they're equal. Starting off I do a check to see if the input is negative, since if it's negative I know the output is going to be false. In addition to that I check  To reverse the int, I shave off numbers by modding it by `10`, then decrementing it by dividing it by `10`.


The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of digits in your input (should be around `O(log(x))` where `x` is the input integer). The memory cost is `O(1)` since the only memory we use is a static number of variables.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        // Declare / initialize the variables
        int copy, reversed;
        
        reversed = 0;
        copy = x;
        
        // Check if negative
        if (x < 0) return false;
        
        // Reverse the integer
        while (copy != 0)
        {
            reversed *= 10;
            reversed += copy % 10;
            copy /= 10;
        }

        // Cmp the reversed with the input
        return reversed == x;
    }
}
```

## Java Integer Reversal Half

So this algorithm was an improved one from leetcode. It's the same concept, however it's improved. In the earlier algorithm, I copied the input value to a variable and decremented that during this reversal. This algorithm just directly decrements the input. That way, we only need to reverse half of the integer, since the value we are comparing it to is the other half.

Now when we do this, and if the number of digits is odd, then the reversed int will have one extra digit then the integer it's being compared to. We can just divide it by zero to disregard it (because in a palindrome, only the middle digit matters).

The runtime cost is still `(O(n))` where `n` is the number of digits, however in this instance we only need to iterate through half of the digits versus all of them, so it leads to a slower linear increase. The memory cost is still `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        // Declare / initialize the variab;es
        int copy, reversed;
        
        reversed = 0;
        copy = x;
        
        // Check if negative
        if (x < 0) return false;
        
        // Reverse the integer
        while (copy != 0)
        {
            reversed *= 10;
            reversed += copy % 10;
            copy /= 10;
        }

        // Cmp the reversed with the input
        return reversed == x;
    }
}
```
