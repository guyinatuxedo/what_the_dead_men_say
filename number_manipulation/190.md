## Description

Example 1:

Input: 00000010100101000001111010011100
Output: 00111001011110000010100101000000
Explanation: The input binary string 00000010100101000001111010011100 represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is 00111001011110000010100101000000.

Example 2:

Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 10111111111111111111111111111111
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 represents the unsigned integer 4294967293, so return 3221225471 which its binary representation is 10111111111111111111111111111111.

 

Note:

    Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
    In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 2 above the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the signed integer -1073741825.


## Java Bit Reversal

So my solution involves iterating through each of the 32 bits in the input integer, and checking if it is set. If it is set, then I set the reverse bit on the return integer.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(1)` (the for loop will run a constant 32 times). The memory cost for this algorithm is also `O(1)` since I just use a static amount of variables with fixed sizes.

```
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        int x, tmp;
        x = tmp = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the 32 bits
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++)
        {
            // Check if the bit is set
            if (((1 << i) & n) != 0)
            {
                // Set the reverse bit
                x = x | (1 << (31 - i));
            }
        }
        
        return x;
    }
}
```
