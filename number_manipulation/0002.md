## Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```


## Java Iterative

This is my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is to add all of the numbers one by one. We iterate through, until we've reached the end of both linked lists, and the carry value is `0`. Until we reach this point, we aren't done adding. So for each iteration, we grab the next number from the linked lists (assuming we haven't reached the end), and add those two numbers along with the carry value. We calculate the new carry and digit values from that, construct the next node, and move on to the next two numbers in the linked list.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the larger size of either of the linked lists (we iterate through both at the same time). The memory cost which stems from the output linked list is `O(n)`:

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        int x, y, z, carry;
        carry = 0;
        
        // Check for empty inputs
        if (l1 == null && l2 == null) return l1;
        if (l1 == null) return l2;
        if (l2 == null) return l1;
        
        ListNode newHead, working, prev;
        working = new ListNode();
        newHead = working;
        prev = null;
        
        // Iterate through both lists
        while (l1 != null || l2 != null || carry != 0) {
            // Grab current numbers to be added
            if (l1 != null) x = l1.val;
            else x = 0;
            
            if (l2 != null) y = l2.val;
            else y = 0;
            
            // Calculate next sum / carry
            z = x + y + carry;
            carry = z / 10;
            z = z % 10;
            
            // Construct next node
            working.val = z;
            working.next = new ListNode();
            prev = working;
            working = working.next;
            
            // Move to next input nodes
            if (l1 != null) l1 = l1.next;
            if (l2 != null) l2 = l2.next;
        }
        
        // Unlink last node, return head
        if (prev != null) prev.next = null;
        return newHead;
    }
}
```
