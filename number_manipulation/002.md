## Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:

```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```


## Java Iterative

So my initial solution involved iterating through the linked lists, to construct the integers the linked lists represent. Then I added them together, and then constructed a linked list from that integer. The issue with this is that it couldn't handle values past the range that an integer could hold. Since the input values are linked lists, they will probably be large enough that they are past that range (otherwise we would just use integers).

Instead I iterated through both linked lists, one node at a time. If one linked list ended before the other, the value that stores the value from that list is set to 0. I added the two values together. Now since a node will only keep track of a single digit, I need to keep a carry digit in case the sum is two digits. After the iteration is done, I need to check to see if there is a remaining `cary` that the last node can be set to. If not we just set the tail next ptr to null.

The runtime cost for this is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes from the larger linked list. The memory cost is the same, because we need to construct a linked list that it's size scales directly with the size of the linked lists (although the exact node count may shift by a few depending on the input values).
