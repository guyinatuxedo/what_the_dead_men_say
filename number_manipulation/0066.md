## Description

Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit.

You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

```
Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.

Example 2:

Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321
```

## Java Array Iteration

This was my first solution to this challenge. The idea behind it is to just do basic addition. I iterate backwards through the array (since the numbers that get changed will start there). Now the main complication here comes from the carry number. Since we are adding `1` to it, there will only be a carry digit if the number being added is `9`. If there is no carry, then we don't have to worry about incrementing the preceding digits. If there is a carry, I first check if it will cause another carry. If it won't I add it, if it will I will continue iterating. If there is a carry after we are done iterating, the output array will be larger than the input, so we make that array.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of digits that can be iterated through. The memory cost is either `O(n)` when we need to allocate a new output array, or `O(1)` when we don't:

```
class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        int n, carry, x;
        n = digits.length;
        carry = 0;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Deal with the carry
            if (carry > 0) {
                // Add carry and return
                if (digits[i] + carry < 10) {
                    digits[i] += carry;
                    carry = 0;
                    return digits;
                }
                
                // Carry will cause another carry
                else {
                    x = digits[i] + carry;
                    digits[i] = x % 10;
                    carry = x / 10;
                }
                continue;
            }
            
            // Adding one will not cause a carry
            if (digits[i] != 9) {
                digits[i] += 1;
                return digits;
            }
            
            // Adding one will cause a carry
            else {
                digits[i] = 0;
                carry += 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Return Array has more digits then input
        if (carry != 0) {
            int[] newDigits = new int[n + 1];
            newDigits[0] = carry;
            for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
                newDigits[i] = digits[i - 1];
            }
            
            return newDigits;
        }
        
        return digits;
    }
}
```

## Java Array Iteration Improved

So this is a simpler solution from leetcode. The thing is, since we are only adding `1`, the max a value will get incremented by is `1`. The same thing goes with carry values. Also the only time there will be a carry value is `9`, in which case it will become `10` (digit in that place of `0`, carry of `1`). So for both adding the initial `1` and the carry value, we can just check if it is `9` or another number. After the iteration if the final number is `0`, that means that all input numbers were `9`. So the final output number will be `1000...` where the number of digits is `n + 1`.

The runtime and memory cost for this solution is the same as the above one.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        int n = digits.length;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // If digit is not 9, no carry
            if (digits[i] != 9) {
                digits[i] += 1;
                return digits;
            }
            
            // If digit is 9, carry and this will be 0
            else digits[i] = 0;
        }
        
        // If the greatest digit is 0, the output array is larger
        if (digits[0] == 0) {
            int[] newDigits = new int[n + 1];
            newDigits[0] = 1;
            return newDigits;
        }
        
        return digits;
    }
}
```
