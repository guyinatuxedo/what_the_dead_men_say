## Description

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

## Java Iteration

This was my first attempt at this challenge. The idea behind it, is we jump to the highest value spot. This works for most cases, but not all sadly.

```
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int i, j, n, k, max, tmp, jmax;
        n = nums.length;
        
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        k = 0;
        i = 0;
        tmp = -1;
        
        while (i < n) {
            tmp = i;
            
            jmax = max = 0;
            for (j = 1; j < nums[i] + 1; j++) {
                if ((i + j) >= n - 1) return k + 1;
                if (nums[i + j] < max) {
                    continue;
                }
                else {
                    max = nums[i + j];
                    jmax = j;                    
                }
            }
            i += jmax;
            ++k;
            
            if (tmp == i) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        
        return k;
    }
}
```

## Java Greedy

This was a more effective solution from leetcode. The idea behind it is we iterate through all the spots. As we do, we continually check to see what the max spot is. When we iterate past the spot of our last jump, we move forward to the next max position. This takes into account spots that are lesser than other spots within our range, but get us to the end faster.

```
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        int n, maxPos, maxSteps, jumps;
        
        n = nums.length;
        if (n < 2) return 0;
        
        jumps = 1;
        
        maxPos = maxSteps = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            if (maxSteps < i) {
                ++jumps;
                maxSteps = maxPos;
            }
            
            maxPos = Math.max(maxPos, nums[i] + i);
        }
        
        return jumps;
    }
}
```
