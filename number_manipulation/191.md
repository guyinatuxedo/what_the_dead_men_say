## Description

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

 
```
Example 1:

Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.

Example 2:

Input: 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.

Example 3:

Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

 

Note:

    Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
    In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3 above the input represents the signed integer -3.
```

## Java Bit Iteration

So this was my first solution for this problem. It involves iterating through each bit of the 32 bit integer, and checking if it is set. The runtime is `O(1)` (the for loop will run for 32 times each time), and the memory cost is set at `O(1)`

```
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int num = 0;
        
        // iterate through each bit of the integer
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++)
        {
            // Check if the bit is set
            if (((1 << i) & n) != 0) num++;
        }
        
        return num;
    }
}
```

## Java Anding Bit Manipulation

This solution was inspired from leetcode. It's an optimized version, because the loop here will run once for each bit that is set, instead of each of the `32` bits. We do this by anding the input value by the difference of itself and `1` repeatedly. This is why

Take for instance the binary code `5`:

```
101
```

when we subtract `1` from it, it will flip the least significant bit:

```
100
```

So by subtracting `1` from it, we effectively reset the least significant bit to `0`. Then by anding it by itself not subtracted by `1`, we discard any bits that might have been set before the previous least significant bit, so it leaves us with all of the bits that were in the original number, other than the least significant bit. That is how this algorithm counts the number of set bits.

The runtime algorithm and memory cost are still `O(1)`, however the number of instructions needed to execute this will be less than the previous algorithm.

```
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int num = 0;
        
        // iterate through each one bit
        while (n != 0)
        {
            n &= (n-1);
            num++;
        }
        
        return num;
    }
}
```
