## Description

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

## Java Recursion

So this is probably the easiest to write solution for this problem. I just make recursive calls until I hit `1` or `0`, then summate them.

In terms of runtime and memory complexity, this is pretty bad. The runtime cost is `O(2^n)` because of the two recursive calls for each `fib` call (assuming the `(N <= 1)` condition is not met). The memory cost is also `O(n)` due to the call stack, from the recursive calls. 

```
class Solution {
    public int fib(int N) 
    {
        if (N <= 1) return N;
        return fib(N - 1) + fib(N - 2);        
    }
}
```

## Java Iteration 

This is a better solution to solve this problem. Essentially we just have a for loop that iterates through, summing up the previous values, until we have the output we want.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution 
{
    public int fib(int N) 
    {
        int working, past0, past1;
        
        // Check for N of 0, 1, and 2
        // Since it doesn't work with the iteration
        if (N <= 1) return N;     
        if (N == 2) return 1;
        
        
        working = 0;
        past0 = past1 = 1;
        
        // Calculat the output value
        for (int i = 3; i <= N; i++)
        {
            working = past0 + past1;
            past0 = past1;
            past1 = working;
        }
        
        return working;
    }
}
```
