## Description

Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n.

## Java Sieve of Eratosthenes

The original solution I tried didn't have a great runtime. It involved iterating through each number from `2` to `n`, and checking if it was prime. There is a much better way to do this.

So this solution uses an algorithm called Sieve of Eratosthenes. The idea behind it is we have an array from `2` to `n` of booleans, that represent if a number is prime or not. We initialize it all to true. Then after that we loop from `2` to `(n)^(1/2)`. We take each number, square it, and set all of it's multiples up to `n` to be false, since there are a multiple they aren't prime. Then we just iterate through the list once more and count the number of primes left. 

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n * log(log(n)))` where `n` is the input number. The memory cost is `O(n)` because of the array.

```
class Solution
{
    public int countPrimes(int n)
    {
        // Initialize the array
        boolean[] primes = new boolean[n];
        int x = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        {
            primes[i] = true;
        }
        
        // Iterate through all numbers between 2 -> n^(1/2)
        for (int i = 2; i * i < n; i++)
        {
            // If this has already been marked as not a prime
            // we can skip it
            if (!primes[i]) continue;
            // Mark the non-prime values
            for (int j = i * i; j < n; j += i)
            {
                primes[j] = false;
            }
        }
        
        // Count all primes, and return them
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++)
        {
            if (primes[i]) x += 1;
        }
        
        return x;
    }
}
