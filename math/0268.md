## Description

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

## Java Math (basic summation)

So this was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is simple. I first calculate the sum of all of the numbers in the input array, if the missing number was present. This sum will be equal to `0 + 1 + ... n + 1`. Then to find the missing numbers I just subtract all of the input numbers from this sum, and the remaining number will be the missing number.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(2n)` -> `O(n)`, which come from the two linear passes that this algorithm makes. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution 
{
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) 
    {
        int n, sum;
        
        n = nums.length; 
        sum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the summation of all of the numbers from 1 to n + 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++)
        {
            sum += i;
        }
        
        // Subtract all nums digits from sum
        // difference will be missing number
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            sum -= nums[i];
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```

## Java Math Optimized (basic summation)

So off of leetcode, there was an optimized version of my algorithm above. Turns out there is an equation that we can use to calculate the sum if the missing number was present, instead of iterating through the input array. This makes it from 2 passes through the input array to one. The runtime cost is still `O(n)` (but only one linear pass through the input) and the memory cost is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution 
{
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) 
    {
        int n, sum;
        
        n = nums.length; 
        sum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the sum with the
        // missing number present
        sum = ((n * (n + 1)) / 2);
        
        // Subtract all nums digits from sum
        // difference will be missing number
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            sum -= nums[i];
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```
