## Description

There is a hidden integer array arr that consists of n non-negative integers.

It was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]. For example, if arr = [1,0,2,1], then encoded = [1,2,3].

You are given the encoded array. You are also given an integer first, that is the first element of arr, i.e. arr[0].

Return the original array arr. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.

## Java Iteration

So for this solution, we allocate an output array, and then calculate the decoded values. The runtime algorithm which comes from iterating through the input array is `O(n)`, and the output cost is also `O(n)` because of the output array.

```
class Solution {
    public int[] decode(int[] encoded, int first) {
        int[] return_array;
        int i, j, x, n;
        
        n = encoded.length;
        
        return_array = new int[n + 1];
        
        x = first;
        
        return_array[0] = x;
        
        j = 0;
        
        for (i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            x ^= encoded[j];
            return_array[i] = x;
            j++;
        }
        
        return return_array;
    }
}
```
