## Description

Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?


## Java Iterative O(1) memory

So for this solution, I wanted to make an iterative solution that had `O(1)` memory consumption. This could be done via directly editing the existing linked list, while having a constant memory size defined by a few memories. 

The algorithm is essentially just iterating through the linked list, grab the next pointer for a node, (and the next pointer for the node after that), set the next node equal to the current node, and move up a node. Iterate through until you have exhausted the entire list. So in total, there are three variables we need to store. The current node which we are reversing, it's next pointer which we will reverse it's next to point to the current node, and the node after it which we will need to continue iterating through the list.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, since the loop will run once per node.

Here is the code for my solution
```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        // Check for a null list
        if (head == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        
        // Initialize our values for the iteration
        ListNode node = head;
        ListNode nxtNode = node.next;
        ListNode tmp = null;
        
        // Set the soon to be last node to null
        node.next = null;
        
        // Iterate through the list
        while(nxtNode != null)
        {
            tmp = nxtNode.next;
            nxtNode.next = node;
            node = nxtNode;
            nxtNode = tmp;
        }
        
        return node;
    }
    

}
```

## Java Recursive

To understand how to effectively do this, leetcode helped me. So effectively we need to reverse the order of the nodes recursively. To do this recursively, what we will do is make recursive calls starting at the head, and make our way to the node right before the tail. Then we will begin reversing. We will reverse a node by setting the next pointer of the next node, equal to the beginning. By doing this, when we edit a Node's next ptr that node has already been reversed, and work backwards. 

One thing we will need to do when going about this approach is setting the next pointer of the current node to null. The reason for this is there could arise a situation where you create a node. Consider for instance a linked list with two nodes. The recursive call for the last node would return that node, and the recursive call for the first node would set the next pointer for the tail to the head. The next ptr for the head would still point to the tail and you would end up in a loop. 

Also another consideration we would need to consider, is that this algorithm needs to return the head of the reversed list. In order to do this, when we have a recursive call that reaches the end, we return that node, and through the recursive calls we return the call all the way through them. That way when the recursive calls are finished, we end up returning that node. 

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, since it makes a recursive call once per each node. The memory cost is also `O(n)` since it makes the recursive call once per each node, which each recursive function call takes up space on the stack.

```

 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        // Check for a null head
        if (head == null)
        {
            return null;
        }      
        
        // Recurse through the list
        return recurseList(head);
        
    }
    
    public ListNode recurseList(ListNode node) {
        // Check if we reached the tail
        if (node.next == null)
        {
            return node;
        }
        
        // Recurse through the list
        ListNode returnNode = recurseList(node.next);
        
        // Reverse the node
        node.next.next = node;
        
        // Set next to null to prevent a loop
        node.next = null;
        
        // Return the tail
        return returnNode;
        
        
    }
}
