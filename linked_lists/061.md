## Description

Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.

```
Example 1:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, k = 2
Output: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 5->1->2->3->4->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL

Example 2:

Input: 0->1->2->NULL, k = 4
Output: 2->0->1->NULL
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 1->2->0->NULL
rotate 3 steps to the right: 0->1->2->NULL
rotate 4 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
```


## Java Loop/Break

This is my solution for this problem. How it works is pretty simple, essentially I attach the tail to the head to make a loop, and then I break the loop where the new head/tail will be. Doing this involves two steps really.

The first is closing the loop, and getting the length of the linked list. Doing this is easy, you just iterate through the list until you get to the tail. Then you set the next point of the tail to the head.

For breaking the loop to get the new head/tail, the first thing we need to know is the index of the new head. To calculate this, I subtract the number of rotations from the length of the list. if the number of rotations is greater than the length of the list, I mod it to get the minimum number of rotations needed (since if we have a list of length five, rotating it `0` times, `5` times, `10` times will yield the same value). Then I just iterate to that node in the list, and break the chain.

This algorithm has a linear complexity of `O(n)`. First off there is an `O(n)` operation where I iterate through the list to get the tail. Then I iterate through it again to get the new head, although how far through the list I go on that run depends on the number of rotations needed. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)` since all I use are a static number of variables.

class Solution {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        // Initialize our variables
        int i, j;
        ListNode node, tail, newTail;
        
        // Check for a null head, or list with single node
        if ((head == null) || (head.next == null)) return head;
        
        // Iterate through the list to find the tail
        i = 2;
        node = head.next;
        while(node.next != null)
        {
            node = node.next;
            i++;
        }

        // Link the tail node to the head, make a loop
        tail = node;
        tail.next = head;
        
        // If cycle number is greater than length of list
        // Remove unneeded rotations
        if (k >= i)
        {
            k = k % i;
        }
        
        // Calculate the index of the new head
        j = i - k;

        // Initialize our values for the next loop
        newTail = head;
        node = head.next;
        i = 1;
        
        // Find the new head/tail
        while(i != (j))
        {
            newTail = node;
            node = node.next;
            i += 1;
        }
        
        // Break the cycle
        newTail.next = null;
        
        // node is the new head
        return node;
    }
}
