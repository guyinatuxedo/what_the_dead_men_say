## Description

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

## Python3 Hash Table Iteration

This algorithm is pretty identical to my algorithm from `141`. The only real difference is I change the return value from `True/False` to `None/Node`. The runtime/memory cost is the same:

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Check for a None head
        if head == None:
            return None
        
        # Initialize the dictionary
        hashMap = defaultdict(int)

        # Iterate through the linked list
        while head:
            # Check if we have seen this node already
            if hashMap[head] == True:
                return head

            # Mark the node as seen in the hash list
            else:
                hashMap[head] = True
                head = head.next
        
        # No loops in the linked list
        return None
```

## Python3 "Circular" nodes

This is also pretty similar to the `141 Python3 "Circular" nodes`. How we go about determining if a loop exists is exactly the same. The only difference is that we need to identify the start of the loop.

To do this, we can leverage some math. Since the two nodes start at the same spot, but one moves double the speed of the other one, we can assume the faster one has moved double the amount of nodes as the slower one. As a result of this, if we were to start one node at the head and one where they intersect and set them going forward at the same speed, they would meet in the middle. Which in this instance it would be at the start of the loop.

Also like the other solution, the runtime cost here is `O(n)` and the memory cost is `O(1)`

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    # Helper function to get start of cycle from
    # Intersection and head
    def getCycleStart(self, head, intersection):
        # Establish our two starting nodes
        nodeX = head
        nodeY = intersection
        
        # Iterate until they intersect
        while (nodeX != nodeY):
            nodeX = nodeX.next
            nodeY = nodeY.next
            
        return nodeX
    
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Check for a None head / None head next
        if head == None:
            return None
        
        if head.next == None:
            return None
        
        # Initialize our two pointers
        nodeX = head
        nodeY = head
        
        # Start iterating through our pointers
        while (nodeY != None):
            # Move the slower pointer forward
            nodeX = nodeX.next
            
            # check for a null next pointer
            if (nodeY.next == None):
                return None
            nodeY = nodeY.next.next
            
            # If the nodes overlap, we have a loop
            if (nodeX == nodeY):
                # Return the start of the cycle
                return self.getCycleStart(head, nodeY)
        
        # If we reached this, there is no loop
        return None
```

## Java HashSet

So this solution is to use a Hashset, to check if we've seen a node before. The first node we've seen repeated will be the first node in the linked list loop. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` which comes from the linear iteration, and the HashSet comes with the memory cost of `O(n)`:

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        HashSet<ListNode> seenNodes;
        seenNodes = new HashSet<ListNode>();
        
        // Iterate through the linked list
        while (head != null) {
            // Check if we've seen this node
            if (seenNodes.contains(head)) return head;
            
            // Not a loop, add the loop to the set, move onto next
            seenNodes.add(head);
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        // No loop
        return null;
    }
}
```
