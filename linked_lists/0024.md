## Description

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.


Example:

Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.

## Java Iterative

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind this solution is I iterate through the linked list. For each iteration, I swap the next two nodes, and then set the next ptr from the previous node equal to the current pair. The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the list, and the memory cost is `O(1)`.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode working, tmp, prev;
        
        // Check for empty or single node input
        if (head == null) return null;
        if (head.next == null) return head;
        
        // Setup the head
        working = head;
        head = head.next;
        working.next = head.next;
        head.next = working;
        
        prev = working;
        working = working.next;
        
        // Begin iteration
        while ((working != null) && (working.next != null)) {
            tmp = working.next;
            working.next = tmp.next;
            tmp.next = working;
            prev.next = tmp;
            
            prev = working;
            working = working.next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

## Java Recursion

So this is my second solution to this problem, and is a bit easier to code but a bit worse performance. It uses recursion. The process is, first you check for a null or single input. Then you swap the next pair of nodes, make a recursive call for the next pair, then link the two pairs. The runtime cost and memory cost (runtime from recursion, memory cost from recursive callstack) is `O(n/2)` -> `O(n)` (since each recursive call is for each pair) where `n` is the length of the input.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode working, tmp, prev;
        
        // Check for empty or single node input
        if (head == null) return null;
        if (head.next == null) return head;
        
        // Swap the node pair
        working = head.next;
        tmp = working.next;
        working.next = head;
        
        // Link the previous pair with the next pair
        head.next = swapPairs(tmp);
        
        return working;
    }
}
```
