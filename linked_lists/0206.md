## Description

Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?


## Java Iterative O(1) memory

This was my first solution to this challenge. The idea behind it is this. I iterate through the linked list, reversing each node as we go. To reverse the node, I just set the next node to the previous node we iterated to in the array. After we are done iterating, `prev` will hold the new head of the linked list.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` since we iterate through each node. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev, next;
        
        prev = null;
        
        // Iterate through linked list, swapping the order
        while (head != null) {
            next = head.next;
            head.next = prev;
            prev = head;
            head = next;     
        }
        
        return prev;
    }
}
```

## Java Recursive

This was my second solution to this problem. The idea of it came from one of the leetcode solutions, so I figured I would implement a solution for it. It's basically the same as the above solution, it just uses recursion instead of iteration. The runtime cost is `O(n)`, but the memory cost increases to `O(n)` because of the recursive call stack.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        // Check for empty input
        if (head == null) return head;
        
        return recursiveReverse(head, null);
    }

    private ListNode recursiveReverse(ListNode head, ListNode prev) {
        ListNode next;
        
        // Reverse this node
        next = head.next;
        head.next = prev;
        
        // Check if we've reached the end of the list
        if (next == null) return head;
        
        // Make recursive call to next node
        return recursiveReverse(next, head);
    }
}
```
