## Description

Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.

## Java Node Shift

So the hardest thing about this problem, is that we have no way to know what the node that links to this node. Since this is a singly linked list, we need to know the previous node to remove a node that it links to. So what we do, is we shift it up by one. We set the current node equal to the next node, then unlink that node. This won't work for deleting the tail node. The runtime and memory cost are both `O(1)`:

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```
