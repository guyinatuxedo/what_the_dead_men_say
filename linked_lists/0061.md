## Description

Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.

```
Example 1:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, k = 2
Output: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 5->1->2->3->4->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL

Example 2:

Input: 0->1->2->NULL, k = 4
Output: 2->0->1->NULL
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 1->2->0->NULL
rotate 3 steps to the right: 0->1->2->NULL
rotate 4 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
```


## Java Loop/Break

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We link the end of the linked list to the beginning, so it makes a cycle. To do this, we iterate to the end of the linked list. At the same time, we get the length of the list. Then we calculate the index of the new head. We do this by modding the `k` value by `n`. The reason for it is if `k` is greater than `n`, that means it's going to make us loop around the linked lists. Since looping around lands us at the same spot, doesn't change the outcome and just costs additional instructions, we can ignore it. Then we iterate up to right before the new head. We then break the cycle via setting the next ptr to null for the node before the new head, and we return the new head.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, which mainly comes from iterating through the entire linked list the first time. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`:

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        // Check for empty input
        if (head == null) return head;
        
        int n = 0;
        int newHead, i;
        ListNode working;
        
        working = head;
        
        // Get the tail of the linked list
        // and the length
        while (working.next != null) {
            n += 1;
            working = working.next;
        }
        
        n += 1;
        
        // Form the cycle, link tail to the head
        working.next = head;
        
        // Calculate the index of the new head
        k = k % n;
        newHead = n - k;
        
        // Iterate to right before the new head
        working = head;
        for (i = 1; i < newHead; i++) {
            working = working.next;
        }
        
        // Grab the new head
        head = working.next;
        
        // Break the cycle, return the head
        working.next = null;
        return head;
    }
}
```
