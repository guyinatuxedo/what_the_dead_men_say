## Description

Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

## Java Setinel Nodes

So for this problem, what we effectively have to do, is create two linked lists and then link them. One with the even positions, another for the odd. This solution iterates through the input list, inserting them into two seperate lists with a setinel node to make it simpler. Then after it, I link the lists together. The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode oddSetinel, evenSetinel, oddWorking, evenWorking;
        int i;
        
        oddWorking = oddSetinel = new ListNode();
        evenWorking = evenSetinel = new ListNode();
        
        i = 1;
        
        // Iterate through the list
        while (head != null) {
            // Add to the even list
            if ((i % 2) == 0) {
                evenWorking.next = head;
                evenWorking = evenWorking.next;
            }
            
            // Add the to the odd list
            else {
                oddWorking.next = head;
                oddWorking = oddWorking.next;
            }
            
            // Move to the next node
            head = head.next;
            i += 1;
        }
        
        // Even list is at the end
        // Null terminate the end of the linked list
        evenWorking.next = null;
        
        // Link the odd and the even lists together
        oddWorking.next = evenSetinel.next;
        return oddSetinel.next;
    }
}
```

## Java Linked List Iteration, Two Tails

So this was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it, is I iterate through the linked lists. While I do, I will form two seperate lists, one for the even nodes and one for the odd nodes (odd/even indices, not values). I do this via keeping track of the tail ptrs for both lists, so I can just append to the end of them. I will also keep track of the head of the even list, so after the algorithm is done I can just set the next node of the tail to the head of the even list, to link the two lists together.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the input linked list. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)` since we edit the input list.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode evenTail, oddTail, next, working, evenHead;
        
        // Check for empty list
        if (head == null) return head;
        
        // Initialize the values for the algorithm
        int i = 1;
        working = head;
        evenTail = oddTail = evenHead = null;
        while (working != null)
        {
            next = working.next;
            
            // Node is even indexed
            if (i % 2 == 0)
            {
                // Check if this isn't the head
                // of th even part of the list
                if (evenTail != null)
                {
                    evenTail.next = working;
