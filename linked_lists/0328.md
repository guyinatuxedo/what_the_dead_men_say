## Description

Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

## Java Linked List Iteration, Two Tails

So this was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it, is I iterate through the linked lists. While I do, I will form two seperate lists, one for the even nodes and one for the odd nodes (odd/even indices, not values). I do this via keeping track of the tail ptrs for both lists, so I can just append to the end of them. I will also keep track of the head of the even list, so after the algorithm is done I can just set the next node of the tail to the head of the even list, to link the two lists together.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the input linked list. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)` since we edit the input list.
