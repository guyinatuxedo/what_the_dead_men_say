## Description

Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in one-pass.

## Java Linked List Iteration

This was my first solution to this problem. This solution has three parts to it.

The first part is to iterate to the part of the list which we will reverse. We also save the last node before the reversed portion so we can link the reversed part later. Also there is an edge case where we start reversing from the head, where we don't iterate but set the values.

The second part is actually reversing the list. It's pretty standard list reversal.

Then after that I relinked the head of the reversed list to the previous node, and the newTail to the rest of the list, and returned the original head. There is an edge case where we start reversing from the head, which the original head will be the newTail so we have to return `prev` which will be the new head of the reversed portion.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, since it iterates through the list. More specifically the runtime correlates directly to the number of nodes that need to be reversed, and the number of nodes before the reversed portion, but the nodes past the reversed part don't affect the runtime. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.
