## Description

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

## Java stacks

So this solution revolves around using a stack. The idea is this. We first iterate through the list, counting the length, and pushing the elements onto a stack. We then iterate through the first half of the list, checking it against the counterpart in the second half of the list via popping elements off of the stack.

The runtime cost of this algorithm is `O((3/2)n) -> O(n)` which comes from the 1 and 1/2 iterations through the input linked list. The memory cost which comes from the stack is `O(n)`:

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        ListNode working;
        int i, n;
        Stack<Integer> reverse = new Stack<Integer>();
        
        working = head;
        
        i = n = 0;
        
        // Construct a stack which is the linked list vals reversed
        while (working != null) {
            reverse.push(working.val);
            working = working.next;
            n += 1;
        }
        
        working = head;
        
        while (working != null) {
            // Check if the node is equal to it's counterpart
            if (working.val != reverse.pop()) return false;
            
            // Move on to the next node
            working = working.next;
            i += 1;
            
            // Check if we've iterated through half the list
            if (i > (n/2)) return true;
        }
        
        // Incase input list is empty
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Java Two Pointers List Reversal

So my original idea behind solving this challenge, was to find the start of the second half of the linked list. Then I would have two ptrs, one at the head, and one at the second half. I would then iterate through the list checking if they were equal. This worked in a lot of cases, but not all since it was checking for a type of symmetry found in some but not all palindromes. However an adjustment could be made to the algorithm to make it work in all cases, which came from leetcode.

The improvement is that we reverse the second half of the linked list, then iterate through and check. This makes it so we effectively check the first element against the last element, the second element with the second to last element, and so on and so forth.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O((3/2) * n)` because we iterate through half of the input array three times. The first is to find the start of the second half of the list, the second is to reverse the second half, then the third is to check if the two halves are equal. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`. 

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) 
    {
        ListNode secondHalf, x, y;
        
        // Reverse the second half o the list
        secondHalf = getSecondHand(head);
        x = head;
        y = reverseList(secondHalf);
        
        // Check if the two halves are equal
        while (y != null)
        {
            if (x.val != y.val) return false;
            x = x.next;
            y = y.next;
        }
        return true;
    
    }

    // Get the start of the second half of the linked list
    private ListNode getSecondHand(ListNode head)
    {
        ListNode x, y;
        x = y = head;
        
        while ((y != null) && (y.next != null))
        {
            x = x.next;
            y = y.next.next;
        }
        
        return x;
    }
    
    // Reverse a linked list from node head
    private ListNode reverseList(ListNode head)
    {
        ListNode prev, curr, next;
        prev = null;
        curr = head;
        while (curr != null)
        {
            next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
