## Description

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

## Java Two Pointers List Reversal

So my original idea behind solving this challenge, was to find the start of the second half of the linked list. Then I would have two ptrs, one at the head, and one at the second half. I would then iterate through the list checking if they were equal. This worked in a lot of cases, but not all since it was checking for a type of symmetry found in some but not all palindromes. However an adjustment could be made to the algorithm to make it work in all cases, which came from leetcode.

The improvement is that we reverse the second half of the linked list, then iterate through and check. This makes it so we effectively check the first element against the last element, the second element with the second to last element, and so on and so forth.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O((3/2) * n)` because we iterate through half of the input array three times. The first is to find the start of the second half of the list, the second is to reverse the second half, then the third is to check if the two halves are equal. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

        x = head;
        y = reverseList(secondHalf);

            if (x.val != y.val) return false;
            x = x.next;
            y = y.next;
        }
        return true;
