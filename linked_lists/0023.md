## Description

Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

## Java List Head Insertion

So this was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind my solution here is this. I first iterate through all of the sorted lists heads, to see what node has the smallest value (since the lists are sorted, the head will have the smallest value). I then take whichever head has the smallest value, insert it into the merged sorted list, and move that head up by one. I continue this process until all lists have been merged.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(k * n)`, where `k` is the number of lists, and `n` is the total length of all of the lists combined. The reason for this is determining the next node to be inserted takes `k` steps, and we have to do it `n` times. Since we edit the input array in place, the memory cost is `O(1)`.
