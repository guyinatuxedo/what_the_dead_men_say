## Description

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

## Java Linked List Iteration

So this is the idea behind this solution. We iterate through the linked list once, to get it's total size. Then we iterate through it again, checking which bits are set. Since we know how big the linked list is, we know which bit each node represents, and we can add the value to the output integer.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(2n)` -> `O(n)`. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int getDecimalValue(ListNode head) {
        ListNode working;
        int i, output;
        
        i = output = 0;
        working = head;

        // Grab Length of input list
        while (working != null)
        {
            i++;
            working = working.next;
        }
        
        // Decrement i, since it represents
        // array index of current bit
        i--;

        while (head != null)
        {
            // Check if the bit is set
            if (head.val == 1)
            {
                output += Math.pow(2, i);
            }
            
            // Move to next bit
            head = head.next;
            i--;
        }
                
        return output;
    }
}
```


## Java Math

So this is a much more optimized solution that one of my friends came up with. It only needs a single pass through the input linked list so it has `O(n)` runtime. In addition to that, it only uses a single variable `output` so it has `O(1)` runtime. 

So this is the idea behind the challenge. The linked list we get starts from the greatest digit. Every time we iterate through a node, we add the node's value to output multiplied by two. If the seventh bit is set, that would add the value (2 ^ 6) to whatever the final output is. Two to the sixth is equal to `2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2`, so `2` multiplied by itself size times. That is what the `2 * output` does. Since if the seventh bit is set, it will get added to output, so it won't get multiplied by `2` then. However for the remaining six iterations, for each iteration it will go through one of the six `2 * self`.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

class Solution {
    public int getDecimalValue(ListNode head) 
    {        
        int output = 0;
    
        while (head != null)
        {
            output = (2 * output) + head.val;
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        return output;
    }
}
```
