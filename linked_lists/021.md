## Description

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

```
Example:

Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

## Java Iteration

So my algorithm essentially just solves it via recursion. First off we check for null inputs. For merging the two lists, while the next element of both inputs is not null, I just add the lower item to the output array. When it ends up with only one being not-null (since we've reached the end of the other input) I just iterate through the rest of the remainder.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the sizes of the two inputs. The reason for this is our insertion algorithm only inserts one element from the two nodes at a time. Our space cost is `O(1)`.
