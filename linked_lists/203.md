## Description

Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.

Example:

```
Input:  1->2->6->3->4->5->6, val = 6
Output: 1->2->3->4->5
```

## Java Iterative

My solution effectively just iterates through the linked list, checking if a node has the value specified to be removed. In order to do this, I need to keep track of two nodes. The current node we are evaluating, the node before it. The reason for the node before it is how I remove a node from the list is I set the previous node's next ptr to the node after the node we are trying to remove. 

When I remove a node, I update the current node to the next node but keep the previous node the same since that is the new previous node for the current node. If I don't remove a node, I move both nodes up one.

One thing about this algorithm is when I begin looping, I have to begin with the node after the head. So I included a loop that will check if the head node (or the head node and subsequent nodes) need to be removed.

This algorithm has a runtime cost of `O(n)`, since the number of times the loop runs scales linearly with the number of nodes in the linked list (once per each node that is not handled in evaluating the beginning nodes). The memory cost is `O(1)` since the only variables I keep are `prev` and `node` which doesn't change with a bigger input.

 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        // Check for a null head
        if (head == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        
        // Remove the head values with the specified value
        while (head.val == val)
        {
            if (head.next == null)
            {
                return null;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        // Initialize our values for iteration
        ListNode prev = head;
        ListNode node = prev.next;
        
        // Iterate through the list
        while (node != null)
        {
            // Check if the node needs to be removed
            if (node.val == val)
            {
                prev.next = node.next;
                node = node.next;
            }
            else
            {
                prev = node;
                node = node.next;
            }
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

## Java Sentinel Node

This solution is pretty similar to the above one, and was from leetcode. Now those checks the above solution has prior to iterating through the list come from the fact that the iteration begins checking for nodes after the head. This solution removes the needs for those checks, while doing the same iteration. It does this via adding a sentinel node as a new "fake" head. That way the iteration can begin checking at the head, instead of the node after the head, thus removing the need for those checks. After the iteration is done, the next ptr from the sentinel will be the head.

The runtime cost is still `O(n)`, and the memory cost is still `O(1)`.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        // Add the sentinel node to the list       
        ListNode sentinel = new ListNode(0);
        sentinel.next = head;
        
       
        // Initialize our values for iteration
        ListNode prev = sentinel;
        ListNode node = sentinel.next;
        
        // Iterate through the list
        while (node != null)
        {
            // Check if the node needs to be removed
            if (node.val == val)
            {
                System.out.println("What's this?");
                prev.next = node.next;
                node = node.next;
            }
            else
            {
                prev = node;
                node = node.next;
            }
        }
        
        // The new head will be the next ptr from the sentinel
        return sentinel.next;
    }
}
```
