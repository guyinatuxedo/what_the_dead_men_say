## Description 

Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Java Linked List Iteration

This was my first solution to this problem.The idea behind this solution is this. We iterate through the list `1.5` times. The first time is to find the size of the linked list. Once we have that, we know the index of the middle node, so we just iterate there to get that node. The runtime cost associated with this is `O(n)`, and the memroy cost is `O(1)`.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return head;
        
        ListNode working = head;
        int size = 0;
        
        // Get size of linked list
        while (working != null) {
            working = working.next;
            ++size;
        }
        
        // Calculate the middle index
        int middle = size / 2;
        
        // Get the middle listnode
        working = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < middle; i++) working = working.next;
        
        return working;
    }
}
```

## Java ArrayList

This was my second solution to this problem. The purpose of this solution is to eliminate the second pass we make. We do this via an ArrayList which we store the linked list nodes in, so once we have the middle index we can just grab and return that node. The runtime cost associated with this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost increases to `O(n)` because of that ArrayList.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ArrayList<ListNode> nums = new ArrayList<ListNode>();
        
        if (head == null) return head;
        
        ListNode working = head;
        int size = 0;
        
        // Get size of linked list
        while (working != null) {
            nums.add(working);
            working = working.next;
            ++size;
        }
        
        // Calculate the middle index
        int middle = size / 2;
        
        return nums.get(middle);
    }
}
```
