## Description

Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once.

## Java Iterate through List

So this was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is pretty simple. I iterate through the linked list from the root to the end. For each node I check if the next node is a duplicate. If it is, I find the next node that is not the duplicate, and set the next node to the one past the duplicates. I then also check if the next node is past the end of the list. Then I move to the next node.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        ListNode current;
        
        current = head;
        
        // Iterate through the list
        while ((current != null) && (current.next != null)) {
            // Nodes are duplicate
            if (current.val == current.next.val) {
                current.next = current.next.next;
            }
            
            // Nodes aren't duplicate, move current up by one
            else {
                current = current.next;
            }
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```
