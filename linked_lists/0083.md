## Description

Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once.

## Java Iterate through List

So this was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is pretty simple. I iterate through the linked list from the root to the end. For each node I check if the next node is a duplicate. If it is, I find the next node that is not the duplicate, and set the next node to the one past the duplicates. I then also check if the next node is past the end of the list. Then I move to the next node.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`.

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }

class Solution 
{
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) 
    {
        // Check if head is null
        if (head == null) return head;
        
        ListNode working, next;
        
        // Set our working node to root
        working = head;
        
        // Iterate through the list
        while (working.next != null)
        {
            // Check for a duplicate
            if (working.val == working.next.val)
            {
                // Iterate past the duplicates
                next = working.next;
                while ((next != null) && (working.val == next.val))
                {
                    next = next.next;
                }
                
                // Set the next pointer past the duplicates
                working.next = next;
                
                // Check if we've iterated past the end of the list
                if (next == null) return head;
            }
            
            // Move onto the next node
            working = working.next;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
