## Description

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

```
    val: an integer representing Node.val
    random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
```
 

Example 1:

```
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
```

## Python3 Recursive

So first off, a deep copy is essentially a copy where we construct new objects and copy the values. So the new copy and the old copy, are two distinct objects.

The algorithm for this is pretty similar to a lot of others. We will leverage recursive calls to construct the new linked list, starting from the head, then moving on to it's `next` and `random` ptrs. Two copy it, what I do is I construct a new node, copy the value, and construct it's `random/next` nodes. 

Now one thing about this is due to the random pointer and our algorithm, we could end up in a situation where we are trying to construct a node that already exists. To handle this I use a hash map. The keys to this are the nodes of the old linked list, and the values are the nodes of the new linked list. Prior to creating a new node, we check the linked list to see if that node exists. If it does, we use it. If not we construct the node and add it to the hashmap.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, since `n` recursive calls will be made. The memory cost is `O(n)` since the hash map will contain `n` elements.

    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)

        self.random = random

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        # Establish our hashtable        
        hashSet = {}
        
        # Our recursive helper function
        def recursiveCopy(head):
            # Check for null nodes
            if head == None:
                return None

            # Check if this node already exists
            if head in hashSet.keys():
                node = hashSet[head]
            
            # Node does not exist, so we construct it
            else:
                node = Node(head.val, None, None)
                hashSet[head] = node
                node.next = recursiveCopy(head.next)
                node.random = recursiveCopy(head.random)  
            
            # Return the node
            return node

        # Construct the tree
        return recursiveCopy(head)
```

## Python3 Iterative 

So this solution involves using an iterative approach. This one has a slight twist thought, where we don't need to use a hashmap for this. This solution was one I saw on leetcode, and thought it would be cool to implement.

Essentially this algorithm focuses on editing the input linked list to make the copy, and doing it without a hash map. Essentially how this will work is we start off by iterating through the linked list and insert `copy` nodes in between the old nodes. Starting off these copy nodes will just point to the next node in the list, and have the copied value. Then proceeding that, we will insert the correct random pointers for the new linked list. Then finally we will separate the new and old linked lists. This way we can do this process without having to allocate memory for the hash map.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is still `O(n)`, since we have to iterate through the list three times. The first time to construct all of the new nodes, the second time to set the random pointers (since not all new nodes are constructed when we are creating the nodes), and a final time to separate the two lists. Since there is nothing else in this algorithm that consumes extra memory, we have an `O(1)` memory cost.
