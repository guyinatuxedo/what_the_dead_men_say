## Description

Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln,
reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

Example 1:

```
Given 1->2->3->4, reorder it to 1->4->2->3.
```

Example 2:

```
Given 1->2->3->4->5, reorder it to 1->5->2->4->3.
```

## Python3 Iterative Solution

This solution is probably the simplest. Essentially this algorithm requires that we reorder the list with the leftmost node, then the rightmost node, then the second leftmost node, etc. Effectively what we do is first iterate through the list, and append each of the nodes to a deque (since `pop` and `popleft` are both `O(1)`). After the deque is constructed, we iterate through the deque. We take turns taking from the left, and then the right side. We take a new node, set the next pointer from the last node equal to this node, and move on to the next. After that we set the final nodes next ptr to None, to close off the loop.

The runtime cost for this is `O(n)`, since we iterate through the linked list twice (although one of them is the deque). The memory cost associated with this is also `O(n)`, since we have to construct the deque, which scales linearly with the linked list (since it contains each node from the list).

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

# Import collections for deques
import collections

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        # Check for None head, and None next head
        if head == None:
            return None
        
        if head.next == None:
            return head
        
        # Make the deque
        nodes = collections.deque()
        
        # Construct the deques which contains all of the nodes
        node = head.next
        while node:
            nodes.append(node)
            node = node.next
        
        # Start the process of reordering
        node = nodes.pop()
        head.next = node
        
        side = False
        
        # Reorder the list
        while nodes:
            # Add a node from the left
            if side == True:
                nextNode = nodes.pop()
                node.next = nextNode
                node = nextNode
                side = False
            # Add a node from the right
            else:
                nextNode = nodes.popleft()
                node.next = nextNode
                node = nextNode
                side = True
        
        # Set final node to None
        node.next = None        
```

## Python3 List Manipulation

This is a more memory efficient solution than the previous one, and is from leetcode. This one revolves around just editing the list itself, without creating an additional data structure (other than a few predefined variables). There are three parts to this algorithm, let's take a look at one instance:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

The first part is finding the middle node. To do this, we iterate through the list while maintaining two pointers. They both start at the head, but one moves forward by one and the other moves forward by two. Once the faster pointer reaches the end, the other pointer should be in the middle. When we run that on the above list, we get `3` as the middle.

The next portion involves just reversing the list from the middle to the end, so we would end up with two lists:

```
1 -> 2 
5 -> 4 -> 3
```

Then finally we merge the two linked lists like this:

```
1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3
```

The runtime cost for this algorithm is still `O(n)`, since the loops we run directly scale with the input size in a linear fashion. The memory cost however shrinks to `O(1)` since there the size of the data this algorithm takes is fixed, with just some variables:


```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

# Import collections for deques

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        # Check for None head, and None next head
        if head == None:
            return None
        
        if head.next == None:
            return head
        
        # Find the middle node
        slowNode = fastNode = head
        while fastNode and fastNode.next:
            slowNode = slowNode.next
            fastNode = fastNode.next.next
            
        # Middle node in slowNode
        node, prevNode = slowNode, None

        # Reverse the list from the middle on
        while node:
            nextNode = node.next            
            node.next = prevNode
            prevNode = node
            node = nextNode
            
        # Combine the two lists
        node0, node1 = head, prevNode
        while node1.next:
        	# Set node.next from first list to second list
            nextNode = node0.next
            node0.next = node1
            node0 = nextNode

        	# Set node.next from second list to first list    
            nextNode = node1.next
            node1.next = first
            node1 = nextNode
```
