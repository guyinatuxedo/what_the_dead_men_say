## Description

Remove all elements from a linked list of integers that have value val.

Example:

```
Input:  1->2->6->3->4->5->6, val = 6
Output: 1->2->3->4->5
```

## Java Iterative

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We first check if the head is valid. After that, we just iterate through the entire list, checking if the next node is valid (which we know the node we are currently on is valid). The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`:

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        ListNode working;
        
        // Check for null input
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        // Ensure head of list is valid
        while ((head != null) && (head.val == val)) {
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        working = head;
        
        // Iterate through the rest of the list
        while ((working != null) && (working.next != null)) {
            // Check if the next node needs to be removed
            if (working.next.val == val) {
                working.next = working.next.next;
            }
            
            // The next node is valid
            else {
                working = working.next;
            }
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

## Java Sentinel Node

This solution is pretty similar to the above one, and was from leetcode. This idea behind it is, we have a fake head that we use. This way, it eliminates the need to check if the head is valid, and we just iterate through the rest of the list checking it. After we are done, we just return the node right after the setinel node. The runtime cost is still `O(n)`, and the memory cost is still `O(1)`:

```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        ListNode setinel, working;
        
        // Setup the setinel and working nodes
        setinel = new ListNode();
        
        setinel.next = head;
        working = setinel;
        
        // Iterate through the list
        while (working.next != null) {
            // Check if node needs to be removed
            if (working.next.val == val) {
                working.next = working.next.next;
            }
            
            // Node is valid
            else {
                working = working.next;
            }
        }
        
        // Correct list begins right after setinel node
        return setinel.next;
    }
}
```
