## Description

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

```
Example:

Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

Note:

Given n will always be valid.
```

## Java Single Pass Iteration

So my solution for this involves making a pass through the linked list, until we reach the tail. However while we are iterating through the list, we will keep track of a node `rmNxt`. The idea behind this value is when we are done iterating through the list, this will be the node directly before the node we are removing. That way to remove the node, we can just set `rmNxt.next` equal to `rmNxt.next.next`.

We accomplish this by having `rmNxt` iterate through the linked list along with `head`, but after waiting for `n` number of iterations. This lag will cause it to end up where we want it to.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, since we make a single pass through the linked list. The memory cost for this algorithm is `O(1)`, since we just use some static variables.

 *     int val;

class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode rmNxt, origHead;
        int i;
        
        // Initialize iteration count
        i = 1;
        
        // Check for null input
        if (head == null) return head;
        
       // Initialize ListNode objects 
        rmNxt = origHead = head;
        
        // Iterate through the list
        while (head.next != null)
        {
            i += 1;
            // We have reached the point,
            // start moving our rmNxt node up
            if (i >= (n + 2))
            {
                rmNxt = rmNxt.next;
            }
            
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        // Check if we are removing the head node
        if (i == n) return origHead.next;
        
        // Remove the element, return the list
        rmNxt.next = rmNxt.next.next;
        
        return origHead;
    }
}
