## Java Iteration Linked Lists

Full disclosure, after working on this for a few hours, I got help from leetcode.

The idea behind this algorithm, reversing a portion of `k` nodes every time. This is until we reach the point at which we can no longer reverse nodes. There are several problems that are presented to us for this. The first is that when we reverse portions of the linked list, we have to relink them. In addition to that, we have to be able to tell when there are enough nodes left to reverse another portion. After that we have to keep track of the new head.

So what this solution does, is it has a sub function for reversing a portion of the list. It does this via iterating through `k` times of a list, moving each node to the front, and it returns the head of that portion. 

As we are iterating through the list, before we begin reversing, we check if there are enough nodes left via a for loop. This will also tell us the next node for the next portion to be reversed, if there is one.

The new head of the entire linked list will be the first new head. So we just initialize a variable to `null`, and after we reverse a portion, if that variable is `null` we just assign the new head to it.

For linking two new reversed linked lists together, we need to know the new tail of the first one, and the new head of the second. We won't know the new head of the second until we reverse it, so we have to wait until we've reversed both prior to linking them. We know the new head from the helper function. The old tail will be the old head of the linked list prior to it being reversed, so we can just keep that. After we finish iterating, we will need one final link to link the last portion with the remainder of the linked list.

The runtime cost for this algorithm is `O(n)`, and the memory cost is `O(1)`.

```
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseLinkedListPortion(ListNode head, int k)
    {
    	ListNode newHead, ptr, next;
    
    	newHead = null;
    	ptr = head;

    	// Iterate through this portion
    	while (k > 0)
    	{
    		// Grab the next node
    		next = ptr.next;

    		// Move the current node to the front of the list
	    	// Update the new head
		    // Move on to next node
    		ptr.next = newHead;
	    	newHead = ptr;

    		ptr = next;

    		k--;
    	}

    return newHead;
    }

    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k)
    {
	    ListNode ptr = head;
	    ListNode ktail = null;
	    ListNode new_head = null;

        // Iterate through the linked list
	    while (ptr != null)
	    {
		    int count = 0;

		    ptr = head;

            // This part is to check if there are enough nodes
            // for another iteration flip
            // if there are, the count should equal k
		    while (count < k && ptr != null)
		    {
			    ptr = ptr.next;
			    count += 1;
		    }

		    if (count == k)
		    {
			    ListNode revHead = this.reverseLinkedListPortion(head, k);

                // If we don't have the new head, assign it
			    if (new_head == null) new_head = revHead;

                // Link the previous list
                // this won't happen for the first iteration
			    if (ktail != null) ktail.next= revHead;

                // Save the old head which is now the tail
			    ktail = head;
            
                // Move on to the next section
                head = ptr;
		    }
	    }
        
        // Link the final tail
	    if (ktail != null) ktail.next = head;

	    return new_head == null ? head : new_head;
    }
}
