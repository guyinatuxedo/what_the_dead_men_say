## Description

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

## Java DFS

This was my first solution to this problem. The idea behind it is this. We recursively do a Depth-First Search on the input graph, making a mirror copy of each node as we go. Anytime we make a new node, we add it to a hashmap. That way when we hit the same node again, we can just return it.

The runtime cost of and memory cost of this algorithm is `O(n)`, because we make one recursive call per node and because of the hashmap.

```
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<Node>();
    }
    
    public Node(int _val, ArrayList<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    HashMap<Integer, Node> seenIndices;
    private Node retNodes(Node origNode) {
        if (seenIndices.containsKey(origNode.val)) return seenIndices.get(origNode.val);
        Node newNode = new Node(origNode.val);
        seenIndices.put(origNode.val, newNode);
        Node working;
        for (Node neighbor : origNode.neighbors) {
            working = retNodes(neighbor);
            if (working != null) newNode.neighbors.add(working);
        }
        return newNode;
    }
    
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return node;
        seenIndices = new HashMap<Integer, Node>();
        return retNodes(node);
    }
}
```
